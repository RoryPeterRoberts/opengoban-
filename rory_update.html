<h1>Rory's Update</h1>
<p style="font-size: 14pt; color: #666; margin-top: 0;">What We've Built So Far</p>

<div class="short-version">
    <p>We've built the blueprints for a <strong>local trading system</strong> that lets your community swap goods and services without needing banks, the internet, or government ID. Think of it like a high-tech version of "I'll give you eggs if you help me fix my fence" - but with a way to keep track of who owes what to whom.</p>

        <li>The Big Picture</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<hr>

<h2>Why Are We Doing This?</h2>

<h3>The Problem (What We Found in Those PDF Documents)</h3>

<p>Those official documents from the EU and the Bank for International Settlements reveal a plan that's being built right now:</p>

<div class="warning-box">
    <p><strong>1. Digital Money They Control:</strong> They want to put all money on one big computer system they run. If they don't like you, they can freeze your money with a click.</p>
</div>

<div class="warning-box">
    <p><strong>2. Nature Becomes Their Property:</strong> They want to put a price tag on forests, bogs, and coastlines - not to protect them, but to turn them into financial products that banks can trade.</p>
</div>

<div class="warning-box">
    <p><strong>3. Digital ID Required for Everything:</strong> To use their new money system, you'll need a government digital wallet. No wallet = no buying or selling.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>Put simply:</strong> They're building a system where you need their permission to participate in the economy.</p>

<h3>Our Solution</h3>

<p>Build our own system that:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Works without the internet</li>
    <li>Doesn't need their digital ID</li>
    <li>Keeps value circulating in our community</li>
    <li>Can't be switched off by someone in Brussels or Frankfurt</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2 class="page-break">What We've Actually Built</h2>

<h3>1. The Research Database (The Homework)</h3>

<p>We researched everything we need to know:</p>

<p><strong>How other communities did this:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Sardex in Italy:</strong> 3,000 businesses trading without euros since 2009</li>
    <li><strong>WIR Bank in Switzerland:</strong> Been running for 90 years with 60,000 members</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The technology options:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Different ways to build the trading system</li>
    <li>How to make it work without internet</li>
    <li>How to use radio networks when phones don't work</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The legal stuff:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>How to set up a private club that regulators can't easily touch</li>
    <li>What words to use (and avoid) to stay out of trouble</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. The Legal Shield (The Armour)</h3>

<p>We wrote a <strong>constitution</strong> - basically the rules of the club. Here's what it does:</p>

<h4>The Closed Loop Rule</h4>
<blockquote>
    <p>"Our credits have no money value and can never be exchanged for euros."</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Why this matters:</em> If you can't turn it into euros, the government can't call it a "cryptocurrency" and regulate it. It's just neighbours helping neighbours.</p>

<h4>The Asset Lock</h4>
<blockquote>
    <p>"Any land or equipment the group owns can never be sold to outsiders or used as loan collateral."</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Why this matters:</em> This stops banks from ever getting their hands on community property, even if someone tries to sell it.</p>

<h4>The Private Club Rule</h4>
<blockquote>
    <p>"This is a private group, not a business. We don't need government ID to join."</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Why this matters:</em> Private clubs have different rules than businesses. We identify members by reputation (your neighbours know who you are), not by passport.</p>

<h4>The Emergency Plan</h4>
<blockquote>
    <p>"If authorities try to shut us down, we distribute everything to members immediately."</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Why this matters:</em> You can't seize what's already been given away.</p>

<p>We also wrote a <strong>one-page agreement</strong> that founding members can sign to join.</p>

<h3 class="page-break">3. The Technical System (The Engine)</h3>

<p>This is the actual computer stuff that makes it work.</p>

<h4>How It Works - Simple Version</h4>

<p>Imagine everyone in your community has an app on their phone. The app keeps track of:</p>
<ul>
    <li>How many "credits" you have</li>
    <li>Who you've traded with</li>
    <li>What people are offering (eggs, firewood, tractor repair)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The clever bit:</strong> The app works even without internet.</p>

<div class="info-box">
    <p><strong>Example: You want to buy eggs from Mary</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>You open your app, type "Give Mary 5 credits for eggs"</li>
        <li>Your phone shows a QR code (those square barcode things)</li>
        <li>Mary scans it with her phone</li>
        <li>Done. Mary now has 5 more credits, you have 5 less.</li>
        <li>Later, when either of you gets near the community wifi, it syncs up.</li>
    </ol>
</div>

<h4>The Community Hub (The Brain)</h4>

<p>This is a small computer (Raspberry Pi - about the size of a deck of cards) that:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Stores everyone's transactions</li>
    <li>Creates a local wifi network</li>
    <li>Runs on solar power if needed</li>
    <li>Costs about <strong>€115</strong> to build</li>
</ul>

<p>When your phone is near the hub, it automatically updates with everyone else's transactions. But if the hub is destroyed or seized, every phone still has a copy of all the data.</p>

<h4>No Internet Needed</h4>

<p>The system works in three ways:</p>

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Method</th>
        <th>How It Works</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><strong>Phone-to-phone</strong></td>
        <td>Scan QR codes directly</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><strong>Local wifi</strong></td>
        <td>Connect to the community hub</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><strong>Radio mesh</strong> (future)</td>
        <td>Little radio devices that can send messages kilometres away</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<h3>4. The Crisis Plans (The Fire Drills)</h3>

<p>We wrote out what happens when things go wrong:</p>

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Scenario</th>
        <th>What Happens</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><strong>Internet goes down for 3 days</strong></td>
        <td>Hub keeps working on local wifi. People trade using QR codes. Nothing breaks, nothing lost.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><strong>Police take the hub</strong></td>
        <td>Data is on everyone's phones anyway. Set up a new hub from any phone's backup. Back running in 4 hours.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><strong>Someone tries to cheat</strong></td>
        <td>Can't send credits to yourself (needs two signatures). Can't build up unlimited credits (maximum of 100). Can't join without real people vouching for you.</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<h3>5. The Actual Code (The Software)</h3>

<p>We wrote working code:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>validate_design.js</strong> - Rules that check every transaction is valid</li>
    <li><strong>ledger-core.js</strong> - The main app logic (850+ lines of JavaScript)</li>
    <li><strong>index.html</strong> - A simple mobile-friendly interface</li>
</ul>

<p>You can actually open the index.html file in a web browser right now and see the app. It's basic but it works.</p>

<hr>

<h2 class="page-break">How Credits Work (The Money Bit)</h2>

<div class="info-box">
    <p><strong>This is NOT cryptocurrency.</strong> It's much simpler.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>Starting Point:</strong> Everyone starts at zero.</p>

<h4>Earning Credits:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Sell eggs → you go positive</li>
    <li>Clean the beach → community gives you credits</li>
    <li>Fix someone's tractor → they give you credits</li>
</ul>

<h4>Spending Credits:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Buy bread → you go negative (down to -50 max)</li>
    <li>Get a haircut → you go negative</li>
    <li>Pay for childminding → you go negative</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Rule:</strong> The total of everyone's balance always equals zero (plus whatever was "minted" for community work). This prevents inflation and cheating.</p>

<h4>Example:</h4>

<pre>
Mary sells you eggs for 5 credits:
  - Mary: +5
  - You: -5
  - Total: 0 ✓

Community rewards beach cleaners with 30 credits:
  - Beach crew: +30 total
  - Nobody goes negative
  - Total: +30 (new credits created for real work)
</pre>

<hr>

<h2>The Words We Use (Important!)</h2>

<p>To stay out of legal trouble, we NEVER say:</p>

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>DON'T Say</th>
        <th>DO Say</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Money, currency</td>
        <td>Credits, units</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Buy, sell</td>
        <td>Give, receive, share</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Payment, price</td>
        <td>Gift, contribution</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Customer</td>
        <td>Member, neighbour</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Business</td>
        <td>Association, circle</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Transaction</td>
        <td>Exchange</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<div class="warning-box">
    <p>This isn't just being cute with words - it's legal protection. "Payments" are regulated. "Gifts between club members" are not.</p>
</div>

<hr>

<h2 class="page-break">What's Left To Do</h2>

<h3>Immediate (This Month)</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Find 10 people willing to be founding members</li>
    <li>Buy a Raspberry Pi and set up the hub</li>
    <li>Test the app with real trades at a market day</li>
    <li>Everyone signs the constitution</li>
</ol>

<h3>Soon (Next Few Months)</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Get legal advice to make sure the structure is solid</li>
    <li>Add the radio mesh network for long-range communication</li>
    <li>Expand to 50 members if the pilot works</li>
</ol>

<h3>Later (Next Year)</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Connect with other communities doing the same thing</li>
    <li>Add better security and encryption</li>
    <li>Maybe build a proper mobile app</li>
</ol>

<hr>

<h2>The Big Picture</h2>

<p>What we're building is an <strong>escape hatch</strong>.</p>

<p>Right now, if you want to buy food, pay rent, or save for the future, you HAVE to use their system - banks, government money, digital IDs. They're about to make that system much more controlled.</p>

<div class="success-box">
    <p><strong>We're building an alternative where:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your neighbours know who you are (not a government database)</li>
        <li>Value comes from real work and real goods (not bank loans)</li>
        <li>The system runs on hardware we own (not their cloud servers)</li>
        <li>It works even when the internet doesn't</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<p>It's not about replacing the euro or living completely off-grid. It's about having <strong>options</strong>. If their system becomes too controlling, you have somewhere else to trade, something that keeps working when their system fails or locks you out.</p>

<h2 class="page-break">Questions You Might Have</h2>

<p><strong>Is this legal?</strong><br>
We believe so. Private clubs trading favours isn't illegal. But we should get a solicitor to review it before going public.</p>

<p><strong>Can the government shut it down?</strong><br>
They can try, but:</p>

    <li>The data is on everyone's phones</li>
    <li>The constitution has emergency distribution rules</li>
    <li>The software is just files - anyone can run it</li>

<p><strong>What if someone cheats?</strong><br>
The system has built-in limits. You can't go more than 50 credits negative. Every transaction needs two people to sign it. The community can vote to remove bad actors.</p>

<p><strong>Do I need to be technical to use it?</strong><br>
No. The app is designed to be simple. Scan a code, see your balance, done.</p>

<p><strong>What's it actually good for?</strong><br>
Trading real things: food, repairs, childcare, lessons, firewood, eggs, vegetables, skilled labour. Anything your neighbours can provide.</p>

<h2>The Bottom Line</h2>

<p>We've built the complete blueprint for a community trading system that:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Works offline</strong> (no internet needed)</li>
    <li><strong>Has legal protection</strong> (private club structure)</li>
    <li><strong>Can't be easily shut down</strong> (distributed across all members)</li>
    <li><strong>Is based on real value</strong> (work and goods, not speculation)</li>
    <li><strong>Doesn't need government ID</strong> (your neighbours know who you are)</li>
</ol>

<p>The foundation is solid. Now we need real people to test it.</p>
