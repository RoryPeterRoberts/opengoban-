Cellular Mutual Credit for Survival Exchange Under Institutional Failure
A Bitcoin-Style Whitepaper Draft
Part 1: Abstract, Introduction, Model, and Design Goals
________________


Abstract
We present a protocol for exchanging goods and services without reliance on fiat currency, banks, or centralized issuers. The system operates as a collection of local “cells,” each maintaining a zero-sum mutual-credit ledger with hard debt limits. Participants earn credit by providing goods or services and spend credit by receiving goods or services, with the cell-wide balance sum constrained to zero at all times. The protocol is designed for collapse conditions where formal enforcement is weak, institutions fail, and coordination for survival becomes primary. We formalize the ledger as a constrained state machine, bound one-shot defection gains via hard credit ceilings, and give sufficient conditions for cooperation as a stable equilibrium in a repeated-game setting. We further define an optional federation mechanism allowing capped inter-cell netting while preventing systemic contagion through severability rules. The protocol explicitly avoids features that invite capture or suppression by states or large actors: there is no central issuer, no yield, no global money supply, and no global clearinghouse.

1. Introduction
1.1 Motivation
When fiat systems remain functional, most people default to money for exchange because it minimizes transaction friction and because legal enforcement backstops contracts. Under economic collapse—hyperinflation, capital controls, bank failures, widespread unemployment, or state capacity degradation—money can fail as a reliable medium of exchange and as a coordination tool. Yet barter is typically inefficient due to the double coincidence of wants. Historically, communities under stress often reconstitute credit before they reconstitute cash.
This paper proposes a mutual-credit protocol intended to support survival-level exchange in adverse conditions. The design target is not “a better currency.” The target is a local-first coordination substrate that:
* permits multi-party exchange without fiat,

* limits extractive behavior by bounding default payoffs,

* remains functional under partial connectivity and censorship pressure,

* scales by replication and severability rather than by global aggregation.

1.2 Why “Cellular”
A global ledger is a single point of failure: technically, economically, and politically. If one network becomes the exchange substrate for a large population, it becomes:
   * a censorship target,

   * a capture target,

   * a systemic-risk amplifier.

We therefore make cells the primary unit: small, geographically compact groups with high interaction frequency and credible local enforcement. Cells can trade internally with high trust density; optional federation allows limited inter-cell exchange without allowing one cell to export unlimited risk to others.
1.3 Design Priorities
We optimize for:
      1. Survivability: ability for participants to obtain essentials via local exchange.

      2. Incentive stability: defection is bounded and dominated under repeated interaction.

      3. Severability: failures are local; contagion is prevented by caps and isolation.

      4. Low capture surface: no global issuer, no yield, no speculative token, no “bank-like” behavior.

      5. Local legitimacy: dispute resolution and enforcement live at the edge, not in opaque algorithms.

2. System Model and Assumptions
2.1 Participants and Cells
A cell C is a set of N participants:
C = \{1,2,\dots,N\}
Cells are intended to be geographically compact and socially legible (not necessarily “friends,” but within a realistic trust-and-reputation radius).
2.2 Ledger Balances
Each participant i has a balance b_i(t)\in\mathbb{R} at discrete time t. Positive balances represent net provision to the cell; negative balances represent net receipt from the cell.
Zero-sum constraint (cell conservation law):
\sum_{i\in C} b_i(t) = 0 \quad \forall t
This is the defining feature of mutual credit: the “money” is not an asset issued by a central entity; it is a ledger of net obligations between participants.
2.3 Unit of Account
We adopt a unit of account designed to reduce speculation and to remain meaningful under collapse. Default choice for this draft:
         * 1 unit = 1 hour of median local labor (a “labor-hour” numeraire).

This is not claimed to be perfectly stable, but it is:
            * locally interpretable,

            * difficult to financialize,

            * aligned with survival exchange (work and goods tied to labor constraints).

(Alternative numeraires—calorie equivalents or a basket—will be treated later as variants.)
2.4 Transactions
A transaction transfers value v > 0 from buyer p to seller q, updating balances:
b_p \leftarrow b_p - v,\quad b_q \leftarrow b_q + v
This preserves the zero-sum constraint automatically.
2.5 Hard Debt Limits
Every participant i has a hard debt limit L_i(t) > 0, and the system enforces:
b_i(t) \ge -L_i(t)
This bound is central. It caps the maximum net extraction a participant can take before losing access, thereby bounding defection payoffs.
We allow L_i(t) to vary only within hard global bounds:
L_{\min} \le L_i(t) \le L_{\max}
and only via transparent local rules (e.g., reputation tiers or council decisions). The protocol must never permit unlimited negative balances.
2.6 Commitments and Future-Dated Services
Survival economies rely on scheduled obligations (food rotations, childcare shifts, repair duties). A protocol that only supports instantaneous spot trades will fail under real conditions.
We model commitments as obligations o due at time \tau:
o = (p \rightarrow q,\ v,\ \tau)
Two modes exist:
               * Soft commitments: obligations are recorded but not escrowed; enforcement is social/governance-only.

               * Escrowed commitments: the system reserves credit capacity for future delivery, preventing over-extension.

We will specify both. The core ledger remains deterministic either way; commitments are auxiliary.
2.7 Threat Model (Preview)
We assume adversarial behavior is present:
                  * Opportunistic defection: default and exit.

                  * Partial shirking: degrade quality or delay.

                  * Collusion: reputation rings, coordinated looting.

                  * Sybil attempts: multiple identities to bypass limits.

                  * External interference: censorship, legal pressure, infiltration by large actors.

We do not assume courts are available or effective. The protocol therefore must be robust under weak enforcement, relying primarily on bounded loss and severability.

3. Design Goals as Formal Properties
We now convert the motivations into explicit properties we want the protocol to satisfy.
Property P1: Conservation (Cell Zero-Sum)
For all admissible state transitions,
\sum_{i\in C} b_i(t) = 0
This prevents hidden issuance, political capture via printing, and “credit inflation” inside a cell.
Property P2: Bounded One-Shot Extraction
For any participant i, the maximum net value extractable before exclusion is bounded above by a function of L_i. Informally:
\text{DefectionGain}_i \lesssim L_i
This creates a tunable “security budget” through L_i, analogous in spirit to how Bitcoin bounds adversarial advantage via economic cost, but here the bound is direct.
Property P3: Cooperation Compatibility Under Repetition
There exist parameter regimes (N, L, \text{enforcement}) such that cooperation is a stable equilibrium in a repeated game with imperfect information. Concretely, we require sufficient conditions under which:
                     * cooperating yields higher discounted utility than defecting,

                     * defection triggers exclusion with bounded loot,

                     * the system remains trade-liquid after shocks.

Property P4: Contagion Resistance via Severability
Failure of a participant should not collapse the cell; failure of a cell should not collapse the federation. This requires:
                        * bounded individual default impact,

                        * bounded inter-cell exposure,

                        * automatic isolation when constraints violated.

Property P5: Low Capture Surface
The protocol avoids structures that invite suppression or capture:
                           * no central issuer,

                           * no yield or interest,

                           * no global settlement layer required for survival,

                           * no single administrative entity required to operate.

These are not just political choices; they reduce game-theoretic attack surfaces by removing privileged rent-extraction positions.

4. Roadmap of the Paper
Next parts will:
                              * specify the protocol precisely (state machine + admissible transitions),

                              * prove conservation and bounded extraction,

                              * derive equilibrium conditions for cooperation,

                              * define federation caps and severability rules,

                              * give parameter selection guidance,

                              * define a simulation-based validation suite.

Part 2: Protocol Specification
Ledger rules, transaction validity, commitments, identity/admission, governance hooks
________________


5. Protocol Overview
The protocol consists of independent cells C. Each cell maintains:
                                 1. A mutual-credit ledger with hard constraints.

                                 2. A membership set (identity/admission).

                                 3. A local rulebook that may tune parameters within global bounds.

                                 4. Optional commitment records for future-dated obligations.

                                 5. Optional federation links to other cells for capped inter-cell exchange.

The core protocol is intentionally minimal: it defines invariants and admissible transitions that any implementation must satisfy.

6. Cell Ledger: State and Invariants
6.1 State Variables
For a cell C at time t, define the state:
                                    * Membership:

M(t) \subseteq \mathcal{I}

where \mathcal{I} is the space of admissible identities and |M(t)|=N.

                                    * Balances:

b(t) = \{b_i(t)\}_{i\in M(t)},\quad b_i(t)\in \mathbb{R}

                                    * Debt limits:

L(t) = \{L_i(t)\}_{i\in M(t)},\quad L_i(t)\in [L_{\min},L_{\max}]

                                    * (Optional) Reserved capacity for commitments:

r(t)=\{r_i(t)\}_{i\in M(t)},\quad r_i(t)\ge 0

                                    * Reputation signal (auxiliary; not required for conservation):

R(t)=\{R_i(t)\}_{i\in M(t)},\quad R_i(t)\in [0,1]

                                    * Event log E(t): append-only record of validated transactions and commitments.

6.2 Core Invariants (Must Hold Always)
I1. Conservation (zero-sum):
\sum_{i\in M(t)} b_i(t) = 0
I2. Hard debt floor:
b_i(t)\ge -L_i(t)\quad \forall i
I3. Commitment safety (if escrowed commitments are enabled):
b_i(t)-r_i(t)\ge -L_i(t)\quad \forall i
I4. No negative reserves:
r_i(t)\ge 0
These invariants are enforced by transaction validation rules (next section).

7. Transaction Semantics
7.1 Transaction Type T1: Spot Exchange
A spot exchange is a tuple:
x = (p,q,v,\text{meta})
where:
                                       * p = payer/buyer (receives goods/services)

                                       * q = payee/seller (provides goods/services)

                                       * v>0 = value in cell units

                                       * meta includes timestamps, optional proofs, and human-readable description.

Validation Rules for T1
A spot transaction is valid if:
V1. Membership:
p,q \in M(t)
V2. Positive value:
v>0
V3. Debt-limit feasibility:
                                          * If commitments are not escrowed:

b_p(t)-v \ge -L_p(t)

                                          * If escrowed commitments are enabled:

b_p(t)-r_p(t)-v \ge -L_p(t)

State Update
If valid, balances update as:
b_p(t+1)=b_p(t)-v,\quad b_q(t+1)=b_q(t)+v
All other b_i unchanged. Reserves r_i unchanged.
Lemma (Conservation): The update preserves invariant I1 automatically.

8. Commitments (Survival Scheduling Primitive)
Commitments allow the system to support planned production/distribution (food rotas, maintenance shifts), which is necessary for “live off the app” operation.
8.1 Commitment Type C0: Soft Commitment (record only)
A soft commitment is:
o=(p\rightarrow q,\ v,\ \tau,\ \text{meta})
It records intent but does not constrain spending capacity.
                                             * Creation rule: any p,q\in M(t), v>0, \tau in the future.

                                             * Fulfillment is executed later by a T1 spot exchange after delivery.

Pros: simplest, low friction.
Cons: higher default risk.
8.2 Commitment Type C1: Escrowed Commitment (reserve capacity)
Escrowed commitment adds reserve mechanics:
                                                * On creation at time t, reserve increases:

r_p(t+1)=r_p(t)+v

                                                * Must satisfy feasibility at creation:

b_p(t)-r_p(t)-v \ge -L_p(t)

                                                * On fulfillment at time \tau, execute the transaction and release reserve:

b_p \leftarrow b_p - v,\quad b_q \leftarrow b_q + v,\quad r_p \leftarrow r_p - v

Pros: prevents over-commitment; reduces “exit scam” capacity.
Cons: reduces flexibility; can feel restrictive.
8.3 Cancellation / Dispute Hooks
Commitments can be cancelled only under:
                                                   * mutual consent, or

                                                   * governance decision (see Section 10)

Cancellation updates:
                                                      * Soft: remove record.

                                                      * Escrowed: release reserve r_p \leftarrow r_p - v.

9. Identity, Membership, and Sybil Resistance (Cell-Level)
A collapse-resilient system cannot assume global identity services. We therefore specify membership as local admission rather than global KYC. The goal is not perfect identity; it is bounded damage and credible local exclusion.
9.1 Identity Primitive
Each participant has a cell-scoped identity ID_i represented by a public key (or equivalent):
                                                         * signing key for transactions

                                                         * optional metadata (name, location, skills)

Importantly:
                                                            * identities are cell-scoped by default

                                                            * cross-cell identity linking is optional, not required

9.2 Admission Rule (Minimal)
A cell admits a new identity if:
                                                               * governance quorum approves (Section 10), and

                                                               * the cell assigns initial parameters (b_i=0, L_i=L_{\text{init}}, R_i=R_{\text{init}}).

9.3 Deposit / Stake (Optional, Non-Fiat)
To reduce Sybil attacks, cells may require an admission “bond” in one of these forms:
                                                                  * service bond: newcomer must complete k hours of tasks before receiving full L

                                                                  * sponsor bond: an existing member sponsors and shares downside via reduced L if the newcomer defects

                                                                  * physical bond: locally held goods/tool deposit (only feasible in tight communities)

The protocol supports these as policy, not as a global requirement.
9.4 Exclusion Rule
A participant is automatically restricted if:
b_i(t) = -L_i(t)
At the hard floor, they cannot initiate further payments. The cell may also:
                                                                     * freeze them (governance),

                                                                     * require restitution plans (governance),

                                                                     * expel them (governance).

This is the primary enforcement lever in weak-rule-of-law environments: access control.

10. Governance Hooks (Local, Bounded Authority)
The protocol does not dictate politics; it dictates constraint-respecting powers.
10.1 Governance Object
Each cell maintains a governance process with:
                                                                        * a council set G(t)\subseteq M(t) (e.g., 5–9 members),

                                                                        * a quorum rule q (e.g., majority or supermajority),

                                                                        * a term/rotation policy.

10.2 Allowed Governance Actions (Must Respect Invariants)
Governance may:
                                                                           1. Admit/expel members.

                                                                           2. Freeze accounts pending dispute resolution.

                                                                           3. Adjust L_i(t) within [L_{\min},L_{\max}].

                                                                           4. Adjust reputation R_i(t) by transparent procedures.

                                                                           5. Authorize commitment cancellations.

                                                                           6. Define local policies (task categories, scheduling norms).

Governance may not:
                                                                              * create net credit (cannot violate conservation),

                                                                              * override the hard floor,

                                                                              * seize balances to create net positive issuance,

                                                                              * promise convertibility or yield.

Formally, any governance action must preserve I1–I4.
10.3 Dispute Resolution Primitive
A dispute is an object:
d=(i,j,\text{claim},\text{evidence},\text{status})
Outcomes can include:
                                                                                 * require a compensating transaction,

                                                                                 * freeze one or both parties,

                                                                                 * adjust L and/or R,

                                                                                 * expulsion.

The protocol’s job is to make disputes survivable: even if adjudication is imperfect, bounded extraction prevents catastrophic loss.

11. Implementation Notes (Protocol-Level, Not UI)
11.1 Local-First Operation
A cell must be able to function:
                                                                                    * with intermittent internet,

                                                                                    * without external payment rails,

                                                                                    * without a central server.

This implies implementations should support:
                                                                                       * local storage,

                                                                                       * eventual consistency within the cell,

                                                                                       * cryptographic signing of events.

11.2 Deterministic Core
The validation rules for T1/C0/C1 are deterministic and auditable. Any “AI layer” must be read-only advisory and must not modify balances or limits outside governance.

13. Economic Security as Bounded Defection
The protocol’s primary security primitive is the hard debt floor:
b_i(t)\ge -L_i(t)
This creates a hard upper bound on how much any participant can extract from the cell without reciprocating.
13.1 Proposition 1 (Bounded One-Shot Extraction)
Assume:
                                                                                             * spot exchanges (T1) are the only mechanism that changes balances, and

                                                                                             * a participant i who defects will be excluded once they reach the hard floor b_i=-L_i (or earlier).

Let b_i(t_0) be i’s balance at the onset of defection. Let G_i be the maximum net value i can receive from others (net consumption) before exclusion.
Then:
G_i \le b_i(t_0)+L_i(t_0)
Proof sketch. Each unit of value received decreases b_i by that amount (buyer pays by becoming more negative). The most negative b_i can become is -L_i. Thus total additional decrease in b_i is at most b_i(t_0)-(-L_i)=b_i(t_0)+L_i. ∎
Corollary (Worst-case looting bound). If participants typically start near b_i\approx 0, then:
G_i \lesssim L_i
So L is the tunable “loss cap” per identity.
13.2 Why This Matters
In collapse, formal enforcement is weak. You cannot rely on courts to punish default. Therefore the system must be designed so that the maximum damage any rational defector can do is bounded and small enough that cooperation remains rational.

14. The Repeated Game: When Cooperation Is Rational
We now model interaction as repeated trade within a cell.
14.1 Setup
Each period, an agent derives utility from access to goods/services mediated by the cell. Let:
                                                                                                * u_i^C = per-period expected utility for agent i when cooperating (continued membership)

                                                                                                * u_i^D = one-time utility from defection (bounded by G_i, itself bounded by L_i)

                                                                                                * \delta_i \in (0,1) = discount factor capturing continuation probability, patience, and expected survival horizon within the cell

The discounted present value of cooperation is approximately:
V_i^C = \sum_{t=0}^{\infty} \delta_i^t u_i^C = \frac{u_i^C}{1-\delta_i}
Defection gives:
V_i^D \approx u_i^D
(plus possibly post-exclusion outside options; we incorporate those below.)
14.2 Proposition 2 (Sufficient Cooperation Condition)
Cooperation is individually rational (a best response) if:
\frac{u_i^C}{1-\delta_i} \ge u_i^D
Using the defection bound u_i^D \le \alpha (b_i+L_i) for some conversion factor \alpha from ledger units to utility, a sufficient design condition is:
L_i \le \frac{u_i^C}{\alpha(1-\delta_i)} - b_i
If we take b_i\approx 0 and normalize \alpha=1 in “utility-equivalent units,” a clean design inequality emerges:
\boxed{L \le \frac{u^C}{1-\delta}}
Interpretation.
                                                                                                   * Larger u^C (cell provides essential value) → can tolerate larger L.

                                                                                                   * Smaller (1-\delta) (agents expect to keep interacting) → can tolerate larger \(L).

- If collapse reduces \(\delta\) (people plan to flee) → you must reduce L.

14.3 Outside Options and “Exit Attacks”
Let w_i be outside-option utility after exclusion (barter, theft, state rations, etc.). Then:
V_i^D \approx u_i^D + w_i
Cooperation condition becomes:
\frac{u_i^C}{1-\delta_i} \ge u_i^D + w_i
This is crucial: if outside options are good (e.g., a functioning parallel market), defection is more attractive, so L must be tighter or membership benefits must be higher.
Collapse paradox: severe collapse often reduces outside options w_i, which makes cooperation easier—if the cell can supply essentials.
________________


15. Liquidity and Seller Acceptance: Not Just “Theft”
Mutual credit can fail without explicit defection if participants refuse to accept credits due to fear they won’t be able to spend them later. This is a liquidity/acceptance problem, which we can model via balance dispersion.
15.1 Balance Dispersion Metrics
Let the mean balance be \bar b = 0 by conservation. Define variance:
\sigma^2(t) = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i\in C} b_i(t)^2
Also define debt concentration:
D(t)=\max_{i\in C}(-b_i(t))
and credit concentration:
P(t)=\max_{i\in C} b_i(t)
High D(t) indicates one or more participants have accumulated large debt near their limit; sellers may fear those debts will never be worked off.
15.2 A Minimal Acceptance Model
Suppose sellers accept credits from buyer p with probability A_p that decreases as p approaches their debt limit:
A_p = f\!\left(\frac{b_p}{L_p}\right),\quad f \text{ decreasing in } -\frac{b_p}{L_p}
A simple linear form:
A_p = 1 - \gamma\left(\frac{-b_p}{L_p}\right),\quad \gamma\in(0,1]
When b_p=-L_p, acceptance collapses.
This implies the system’s trade throughput collapses not only when defection happens, but when many participants drift toward the hard floor.
15.3 Design Implication: You Need “Debt Work-Off” Dynamics
Survival cells require mechanisms (not necessarily coercive) to pull participants away from the hard floor:
                                                                                                      * visibility of high-need tasks,

                                                                                                      * priority matching for debtors to earn credits,

                                                                                                      * temporary throttles on further spending (already enforced),

                                                                                                      * and governance nudges (task rotation, obligations).

This is why the system is fundamentally a coordination/scheduling layer as much as a ledger.

16. Collusion and Sybil: Why Cell Size Matters
16.1 Sybil Impact Bound (If Admission Is Controlled)
If a cell requires admission (Section 9), the attacker’s effective number of identities S is bounded by admission friction. The maximum total extraction is then:
G_{\text{attack}} \le \sum_{s=1}^{S} (b_s + L_s) \approx S L
Thus, the key is to keep S small. This is achieved by:
                                                                                                         * local admission,

                                                                                                         * sponsor bonds,

                                                                                                         * service bonds.

16.2 Collusive Reputation Rings
If reputation is used to raise L_i, colluders can try to inflate one another’s reputations to increase limits and then loot.
Therefore, any rule that increases L_i based on reputation must satisfy:
L_i(t) \le L_{\max} \quad \text{and} \quad \Delta L_i \text{ is slow}
and increases must be rate-limited:
L_i(t+1)-L_i(t) \le \eta
for small \eta. This prevents rapid “pump then dump” attacks.
________________


17. A Practical Parameter Inequality Set
We now have three core inequalities guiding safe parameter choices:
(A) Individual extraction bound
G_i \lesssim L
(B) Cooperation condition
L \le \frac{u^C}{1-\delta} - w
(where w is outside option in equivalent units)
(C) Sybil-limited extraction
G_{\text{attack}} \lesssim S L
so you must enforce small S via admission friction.
These define the “security envelope” of the system.

                                                                                                            * federation math: inter-cell netting, exposure caps, and severability proofs,

Inter-cell exchange without systemic leverage or contagion

19. Why Federation Exists (and Why It Must Be Capped)
A purely local cell can be robust but may lack:
                                                                                                               * specialization (medical, fabrication),

                                                                                                               * seasonal goods,

                                                                                                               * redundancy against local shocks.

Federation enables limited trade across cells. However, federation is the primary route to systemic failure: if cells can run persistent net deficits with others, the network recreates the very leverage dynamics it sought to escape.
Therefore the federation layer must satisfy two properties:
                                                                                                                  * F1: Exposure bounds — no cell can accumulate large net obligations to the rest of the network.

                                                                                                                  * F2: Severability — any cell can be isolated without breaking internal accounting of other cells.

20. Federation Model
Let cells be indexed k \in \{1,\dots,m\}.
Cell k has membership M_k, balances \{b_i\}_{i\in M_k}, and debt limits \{L_i\}.
20.1 Two-Ledger Decomposition
We keep the core idea: local ledgers are primary. Federation is not a global ledger; it is a limited netting layer.
Define for each cell k an external position B_k(t), representing the net claim of cell k on other cells (positive) or net obligation (negative). We require:
\sum_{k=1}^m B_k(t) = 0 \quad \forall t
This is the federation analogue of conservation.
Key design choice: B_k(t) is not a freely spendable “cell currency.” It is a bookkeeping constraint determining how much cross-cell trade is allowed.
20.2 Inter-Cell Transaction
Suppose a member p \in M_a in cell a buys a good/service from member q \in M_b in cell b with value v.
We implement this as two simultaneous local transactions plus a federation update:
                                                                                                                     1. In cell a: p pays v to a local “external clearing account” X_a.

b_p \leftarrow b_p - v,\quad b_{X_a} \leftarrow b_{X_a} + v

                                                                                                                     2. In cell b: a local “external clearing account” X_b pays v to q.

b_{X_b} \leftarrow b_{X_b} - v,\quad b_q \leftarrow b_q + v

                                                                                                                     3. Federation positions update:

B_a \leftarrow B_a - v,\quad B_b \leftarrow B_b + v

Interpretation:
                                                                                                                        * Cell a has imported v from outside and owes the federation v.

                                                                                                                        * Cell b has exported v and is owed v.

20.3 Conservation Holds Locally and Federally
                                                                                                                           * Each cell remains zero-sum internally because X_a and X_b are members of their respective ledgers.

                                                                                                                           * Federation remains zero-sum because B_a and B_b update oppositely.

Thus federation does not break the mutual credit principle; it composes it.
________________


21. Exposure Caps (The Anti-Leverage Constraint)
21.1 Cell Capacity Scale
Within cell k, define aggregate credit capacity:
\Lambda_k = \sum_{i\in M_k} L_i
If all L_i=L, then \Lambda_k = N_k L.
This quantity measures the maximum total net extraction potential inside the cell. Federation exposure should be some small fraction of this; otherwise the cell becomes systemically indebted externally.
21.2 Federation Cap Rule
Define an exposure cap parameter \beta \in (0,1) (small). Enforce:
\boxed{|B_k(t)| \le \beta \Lambda_k}
If all members have equal limits:
|B_k(t)| \le \beta N_k L
Typical safe regime:
\beta \in [0.05, 0.15]
21.3 Why This Works (Intuition)
                                                                                                                              * If \beta is small, inter-cell deficits cannot become large enough to threaten cell survival.

                                                                                                                              * A cell that imports too much is forced to export later (or stop importing).

                                                                                                                              * There is no pathway to create “federation debt empires.”

This is the core mathematical barrier preventing a mutual credit federation from turning into a shadow central bank.

22. Severability and Contagion Prevention
22.1 Definition (Severability)
A federation is severable if, for any subset of cells S, the remainder S^c can continue operating internally without needing settlement from S.
We want:
                                                                                                                                 * internal ledgers stay valid,

                                                                                                                                 * limits still enforce bounded extraction,

                                                                                                                                 * federation connections can be cut without breaking conservation within remaining cells.

22.2 Proposition 3 (Severability Under Exposure Caps)
Assume:
                                                                                                                                    1. Each cell ledger satisfies invariants I1–I4.

                                                                                                                                    2. Federation exposure caps |B_k|\le \beta \Lambda_k are enforced.

                                                                                                                                    3. Inter-cell trade is implemented via clearing accounts X_k as in Section 20.

Then if any cell j is isolated (no further federation trades), all other cells remain internally consistent and can continue trading internally without needing any balance updates from j.
Proof sketch.
Isolation stops further updates involving B_j and other B_k. Since each cell’s internal conservation is maintained by its own ledger updates (including its clearing account), and no other cell requires settlement from j to preserve internal conservation, the ledgers remain valid. Federation claims against j remain recorded in B, but are bounded for each cell by \beta \Lambda_k, limiting harm and preventing collapse. ∎
22.3 Practical Isolation Rule (Automatic Quarantine)
If a cell violates cap constraints or exhibits high-risk signals:
                                                                                                                                       * federation edge is suspended

                                                                                                                                       * cell can continue internally

                                                                                                                                       * re-connection requires returning within bounds

Formally: if |B_k|>\beta \Lambda_k, set federation adjacency A_{k\ell}=0 for all \ell.

23. Federation Liquidity: Preventing “Frozen Claims”
Even with caps, exporters may worry that their positive federation position B_k>0 is not spendable.
We therefore need a spending rule:
23.1 Spendability Constraint
Cell k may import (increase deficit, decrease B_k) up to the cap. Exporters (with B_k>0) can always import later unless:
                                                                                                                                          * they choose not to,

                                                                                                                                          * they are politically/physically blocked,

                                                                                                                                          * or the federation is severed.

This is a real risk under collapse. We mitigate it with:
                                                                                                                                             * multi-edge federation (each cell connects to several others),

                                                                                                                                             * low \beta (claims are small and non-fatal),

                                                                                                                                             * preference for reciprocal trade pairs (reduce net accumulation).

23.2 Anti-Hoarding / Netting Incentive
You may optionally impose a mild decay fee on large positive B_k beyond a threshold to encourage circulation, but this is politically delicate and may resemble “tax.” In the collapse use-case, the simpler solution is:
                                                                                                                                                * keep \beta small,

                                                                                                                                                * encourage reciprocal exchange.

(We can formalize an optimal control here later if you want, but I’d default to simplicity.)

24. Cell Size and Federation Degree (Graph Structure)
24.1 Federation Graph
Model federation as a graph G=(V,E) where vertices are cells and edges are allowed trading relationships.
Each cell should have degree d (number of federation partners) large enough for redundancy, small enough for legibility and governance:
d \in [3,7]
This provides:
                                                                                                                                                   * alternate routes if one cell is isolated,

                                                                                                                                                   * diversified supply,

                                                                                                                                                   * limited exposure and monitoring burden.

24.2 Risk Propagation Bound
In a network with exposure caps \beta, worst-case loss to a cell from immediate neighbors is bounded by:
\text{Loss}_k \le d \cdot \beta \Lambda_k
So choosing small d and small \beta bounds contagion even under correlated neighbor failure.
This is the federation analogue of limiting leverage + limiting counterparty concentration in financial risk management.

25. Summary: Federation Rules as Mathematical Guardrails
Federation is safe if and only if:
                                                                                                                                                      1. Local ledgers remain primary.

                                                                                                                                                      2. Cross-cell trades are routed through clearing accounts and a separate B_k position.

                                                                                                                                                      3. Exposure caps are enforced:

|B_k| \le \beta \Lambda_k

                                                                                                                                                      4. Isolation is automatic and does not break internal operations.

                                                                                                                                                      5. Federation degree d is bounded to limit counterparty concentration.

These make the system scale by replication, not by consolidation.

26. What Comes Next
Part 5 will address the remaining big math gap:
                                                                                                                                                         * optimal parameterization: choosing N, L, \beta, admission friction, and reputation dynamics as a coherent set,

                                                                                                                                                         * plus a formal “survival constraint layer” (task coverage model) so a person can realistically live off the network.

Part 5: Parameterization and Survival-Coverage Mathematics
Choosing N, L, \beta coherently, and modeling “can a person survive on this?”

27. Parameterization as a Constrained Design Problem
We want parameters that simultaneously satisfy:
                                                                                                                                                            1. Bounded loss (security): L small enough that looting is tolerable

                                                                                                                                                            2. Cooperation equilibrium: L large enough that newcomers can function and trade isn’t strangled

                                                                                                                                                            3. Liquidity: balances don’t concentrate at -L across many participants

                                                                                                                                                            4. Sybil resistance: effective attacker identities S remain small

                                                                                                                                                            5. Federation safety: \beta small enough to prevent contagion but large enough for specialization trade

                                                                                                                                                            6. Survival feasibility: essential needs can be met by scheduled production + exchange

This is best treated as a feasibility region in parameter space, not a single “optimum.”

28. The Two Core Scales: Individual Limit and Cell Capacity
28.1 Individual Credit Limit L
L is the maximum net draw a person can make before they must “work back” or stop spending.
28.2 Aggregate Cell Capacity \Lambda
Define:
\Lambda = \sum_{i\in C} L_i
If equal limits, \Lambda = NL.
\Lambda bounds:
                                                                                                                                                               * maximum simultaneous net “claims” by creditors,

                                                                                                                                                               * maximum internal exposure to defaults,

                                                                                                                                                               * maximum internal trade imbalance.

This matters for both liquidity and federation caps.

29. Calibrating L from Survival Economics
To make “survive off the app” operational, we need a baseline for essential consumption.
29.1 Normalize Units to Labor-Hours
We take:
                                                                                                                                                                  * 1 unit = 1 hour of median local labor

Let a person’s essential weekly needs require h_E labor-hours from the cell (food production/distribution, fuel logistics, basic maintenance, childcare, etc.) net of their own contributions.
In a functioning survival cell, a typical adult can contribute h_W hours/week (bounded by health, shock conditions). In collapse, h_W may increase (more time available) but productivity may fall (scarcity).
29.2 Practical Limit Range in This Numeraire
A useful principle:
                                                                                                                                                                     * L should cover a short survival bridge (to avoid immediate starvation spirals)

                                                                                                                                                                     * but not long enough to make default profitable

So pick:
\boxed{L \approx \theta \, h_E}
with:
\theta \in [0.5, 2]
Interpretation:
                                                                                                                                                                        * \theta=0.5: tight discipline; low default loss, higher friction

                                                                                                                                                                        * \theta=1: one week of essential net support

                                                                                                                                                                        * \theta=2: two-week bridge; easier onboarding, higher looting bound

Collapse-hardened default: \theta \approx 1.
So:
\boxed{L \approx h_E \text{ (about one week of essential needs)}}
This ties your “security budget” to survival reality, not arbitrary numbers.

30. Cooperation Condition Restated in Survival Terms
From Part 3, cooperation is sustained if:
\frac{u^C}{1-\delta} \ge u^D + w
We now approximate these in labor-hour terms.
                                                                                                                                                                           * u^D \lesssim L (bounded extraction)

                                                                                                                                                                           * u^C: value of continued membership. If the cell enables survival, u^C is on the order of “weekly essential access” in utility units.

                                                                                                                                                                           * w: outside options (barter/theft/rations). In severe collapse, w is often low and risky.

If we normalize “one week of essentials” as utility 1, then:
                                                                                                                                                                              * u^C \approx 1

                                                                                                                                                                              * u^D \approx \theta (weeks of looting)

                                                                                                                                                                              * w maybe 0.2–0.5 (outside options are bad)

Then cooperation requires:
\frac{1}{1-\delta} \gtrsim \theta + w
Example: if \delta=0.8, then 1/(1-\delta)=5. That can sustain \theta up to ~4-ish. If \delta=0.6, then it’s only 2.5; you need tighter L and/or stronger local enforcement.
Design insight: In “panic flight” regimes where \delta drops, the system must automatically tighten L and increase admission friction, or the incentive equilibrium flips.
So you want a policy:
                                                                                                                                                                                 * default L set for normal times,

                                                                                                                                                                                 * emergency mode reduces L for new accounts and increases bonding.

We can formalize emergency mode later as a state-dependent control, but the math supports it.

31. Cell Size N: Matching Efficiency vs Enforcement Bandwidth
31.1 Matching Efficiency
Let the diversity of skills scale roughly like:
\text{SkillCoverage}(N) \approx 1 - e^{-kN}
for some k>0 (diminishing returns).
31.2 Enforcement Bandwidth / Governance Load
Disputes, monitoring, and social legibility degrade with N. A crude but useful scaling:
                                                                                                                                                                                    * potential pairwise interactions: O(N^2)

                                                                                                                                                                                    * dispute cases often scale with transaction volume, which rises with N

You get a tradeoff: beyond some N, dispute load grows faster than trust and coordination.
31.3 Parameter Recommendation (Now in “why” form)
The feasible region typically falls in:
\boxed{N \in [50,150]}
and the “survival kernel” sweet spot is often:
\boxed{N \in [60,100]}
because:
                                                                                                                                                                                       * enough labor-hours exist for essential roles redundancy,

                                                                                                                                                                                       * enough skill diversity exists,

                                                                                                                                                                                       * yet governance remains human-manageable.

32. Federation Cap \beta: Linking External Exposure to Survival Reserves
From Part 4:
|B_k| \le \beta \Lambda_k
Since \Lambda_k \approx N_k L, federation exposure is bounded by a fraction of “total cell credit capacity.”
Interpretation: \beta\Lambda is the maximum amount the cell can be net-importing from the outside (or net-owed).
To keep federation from becoming a dependency:
                                                                                                                                                                                          * \beta must be small enough that if federation collapses, the cell still survives.

Thus choose \beta based on what fraction of essentials can safely be imported.
Let f be the fraction of essential needs met externally in steady-state. In collapse planning, you want f small (local resilience). Then:
\boxed{\beta \approx f}
Typical robust choices:
\boxed{\beta \in [0.05,0.15]}
                                                                                                                                                                                             * 0.05: almost fully local; federation is icing

                                                                                                                                                                                             * 0.15: meaningful specialization trade but still non-systemic

33. Survival Coverage as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem
This is the missing piece that makes the app more than a ledger.
33.1 Essential Task Set
Define a set of essential task categories \mathcal{T}, e.g.:
                                                                                                                                                                                                * food production & distribution

                                                                                                                                                                                                * water/fuel logistics

                                                                                                                                                                                                * shelter repair

                                                                                                                                                                                                * sanitation

                                                                                                                                                                                                * basic medical support

                                                                                                                                                                                                * security/coordination

                                                                                                                                                                                                * childcare

Each task type t \in \mathcal{T} requires a minimum labor-hours per period (say weekly) to keep the cell viable:
H_t^{\min} \quad \text{hours/week}
Total essential labor demand:
H^{\min} = \sum_{t\in \mathcal{T}} H_t^{\min}
33.2 Labor Supply
Each participant i has labor supply capacity s_i (hours/week) that they can contribute, and skill suitability weights a_{i,t} \in [0,1] indicating effectiveness at task t.
We choose allocations x_{i,t} \ge 0 representing hours assigned by person i to task t, subject to:
\sum_{t} x_{i,t} \le s_i \quad \forall i
and coverage constraints:
\sum_i a_{i,t} x_{i,t} \ge H_t^{\min} \quad \forall t
This is a feasibility problem. The cell is survivable if there exists x satisfying these.
33.3 Why This Integrates with the Ledger
The ledger becomes the incentive mechanism ensuring people actually do x_{i,t}:
                                                                                                                                                                                                   * Completing tasks earns credits.

                                                                                                                                                                                                   * Consuming essentials spends credits (or triggers obligations).

                                                                                                                                                                                                   * People near -L are preferentially matched to available tasks so they can recover balance.

                                                                                                                                                                                                   * This keeps liquidity from freezing at the hard floor.

So the “survival scheduler” is mathematically a constrained allocation system sitting on top of the credit ledger.

34. The Minimal Viability Condition (Cell Can Support Its Members)
A rough viability inequality:
Let average effective labor supply per person be \bar s_{\text{eff}} (hours/week weighted by effectiveness). Then:
N \bar s_{\text{eff}} \ge H^{\min}
But because skills are not uniform, the stronger condition is the feasibility of the coverage constraints in 33.2.
Practical design implication
When forming a cell, the app should require a “role coverage checklist”:
                                                                                                                                                                                                      * do we have enough food hours?

                                                                                                                                                                                                      * enough maintenance hours?

                                                                                                                                                                                                      * enough medical hours?

                                                                                                                                                                                                      * enough logistics hours?

This is not UX fluff. It is survival feasibility.

35. Putting It Together: A Coherent Default Parameter Set
For severe-collapse robustness:

                                                                                                                                                                                                         * Individual limit:

                                                                                                                                                                                                         * Federation cap:

\beta = 0.05\text{ to }0.10

                                                                                                                                                                                                         * Federation degree:

                                                                                                                                                                                                         * Commitment mode:

                                                                                                                                                                                                            * escrowed for essentials (food rota),

                                                                                                                                                                                                            * soft for non-essentials.

This yields bounded looting, cooperative equilibrium in realistic \delta regimes, and survival scheduling feasibility.

Part 6 will turn this into:
                                                                                                                                                                                                               * explicit theorem statements + proof sketches for parameter safety,

                                                                                                                                                                                                               * and the start of a security section: Sybil, collusion, and external interference as formal adversaries.

37. Threat Model (Adversarial Capabilities)
We classify adversaries by what they can do and what they want.
37.1 Internal Adversaries (Members or Admitted Identities)
A1: Opportunistic defector
                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * extracts up to their limit then exits or refuses service.

A2: Shirker
                                                                                                                                                                                                                     * provides low quality, delays, disputes.

A3: Colluding group
                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * coordinates transactions to manipulate reputation or limits; may attempt coordinated looting.

A4: Sybil attacker
                                                                                                                                                                                                                           * attempts to obtain multiple identities to multiply extraction bound.

37.2 External Adversaries (Not in the Cell)
E1: Censorship / disruption
                                                                                                                                                                                                                              * attempts to block servers, app distribution, communications.

E2: Infiltration
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 * attempts to get identities admitted to influence governance or drain resources.

E3: Regulatory / political suppression
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    * targets the system if it appears as a “currency,” “bank,” or “political rival.”

This paper focuses on economic and protocol-level resilience. We treat physical coercion and violence as out-of-scope except insofar as decentralization reduces choke points.

38. Formal Security Objectives
Objective S1: Loss Boundedness
For any internal adversary identity i, the maximum net extraction is bounded by protocol parameters.
Objective S2: Attack Scalability Control
For any attacker controlling S admitted identities, total extraction is bounded by S and cannot scale without admission.
Objective S3: Contagion Resistance
Failure (defection) in one cell does not impose unbounded losses on others.
Objective S4: Censorship Tolerance
The protocol has no single technical or social choke point required for local survival operation.
________________


39. Theorem-Style Results (Core)
Theorem 1 (Cell Conservation)
Under transaction rule T1 and commitment rule C1, the cell balance sum is invariant:
\sum_{i\in M(t)} b_i(t)=0 \quad \forall t
Proof sketch.
Each validated update adds +v to one account and -v to another, or equivalently moves value between accounts. Reserves r do not change conservation. ∎
________________


Theorem 2 (Bounded Individual Extraction)
Let identity i have limit L_i and initial balance b_i(t_0). If the protocol blocks further purchases when b_i=-L_i, then maximum additional net extraction after t_0 satisfies:
G_i \le b_i(t_0)+L_i
(From Part 3, restated as a theorem.) ∎
________________


Theorem 3 (Bounded Multi-Identity Extraction)
If an attacker controls S admitted identities i_1,\dots,i_S, then total extraction is bounded:
G_{\text{total}} \le \sum_{s=1}^{S} \big(b_{i_s}(t_0)+L_{i_s}\big)
If identities start near zero and have equal limits L, then:
G_{\text{total}} \lesssim SL
Implication: the dominant security problem is limiting effective S via admission friction, not “perfect fraud prevention.”
________________


Theorem 4 (Federation Exposure Bound Implies Contagion Bound)
Let cell k have aggregate limit \Lambda_k=\sum_{i\in M_k} L_i. If federation caps enforce:
|B_k| \le \beta \Lambda_k
then the maximum net loss to cell k due solely to federation severance (i.e., claims becoming unspendable) is bounded by \beta\Lambda_k, excluding local internal defaults.
Proof sketch.
Cell k’s net external claim/obligation is represented entirely by B_k. Severance freezes B_k at its current value; internal ledgers remain consistent. Therefore the “external value at risk” is at most |B_k|, capped by \beta\Lambda_k. ∎

40. Emergency Mode as a State-Dependent Control
Collapse dynamics are not stationary. The key risk is a sudden drop in continuation probability \delta and a rise in “exit attacks.”
We therefore define a cell risk state s(t)\in\{\text{Normal},\text{Stressed},\text{Panic}\}.
40.1 Observable Triggers (Protocol-Level Signals)
Define cell indicators:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       * floor mass:

F(t)=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i} \mathbf{1}\{b_i(t)\le -\rho L_i\},\quad \rho\in(0,1)

fraction of members near the floor.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       * default/dispute rate D_r(t): disputes per transaction.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       * balance variance:

\sigma^2(t)=\frac{1}{N}\sum_i b_i(t)^2

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       * membership churn C_r(t): exits per period.

High F, D_r, \sigma^2, C_r indicate a system moving from cooperative equilibrium toward breakdown.
40.2 Emergency Control Policy
Emergency mode adjusts only bounded parameters and access rules, never conservation.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * L_{\text{new}}=L

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * standard admission

Stressed
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             * reduce limits for new accounts:

L_{\text{new}} \leftarrow \lambda_1 L,\quad \lambda_1\in[0.5,0.8]

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             * require sponsor bond or service bond

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             * escrow essentials commitments

Panic
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                * temporary spending throttle for all:

L_i \leftarrow \max(L_{\min},\lambda_2 L_i),\quad \lambda_2\in[0.5,0.9]

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                * freeze federation (set \beta \to 0 temporarily)

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                * prioritize essential task matching for members near floor

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                * strengthen admission gate (supermajority)

This policy operationalizes the inequality:
L \le \frac{u^C}{1-\delta} - w
When \delta falls (panic), reduce L to keep cooperation incentive-compatible.

41. Governance Capture Resistance (Math + Structure)
A big actor can attempt to capture a cell by gaining governance power.
We limit capture by:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   1. Rotation: council membership changes regularly.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   2. Quorum: high-impact actions require supermajority.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   3. Bounded authority: governance cannot violate invariants I1–I4.

41.1 Formal “No Printing” Guarantee
Governance decisions are constrained to preserve:
\sum_i b_i=0
This prevents a captured council from issuing net credit to its allies without simultaneously assigning equal debt elsewhere (which would be visible and politically unstable).
Thus the protocol makes rent extraction harder than in fiat systems: there is no hidden money printer.

42. Reputation as Advisory Only (Preventing Algorithmic Tyranny)
Reputation influences constraints (like L_i) only via bounded, rate-limited adjustments:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * L_i(t)\in[L_{\min},L_{\max}]

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * rate-limit:

|L_i(t+1)-L_i(t)|\le \eta

Reputation never:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         * transfers value,

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         * overrides the hard floor,

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         * auto-expels without governance.

This prevents:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            * rapid collusive limit inflation,

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            * AI-driven exclusion cascades (legitimacy failure),

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            * opaque social-credit dynamics.

43. External Intervention Avoidance as a Design Constraint
From a “state/big actor” lens, the protocol reduces intervention incentives by not resembling:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               * a bank (no deposits, no interest, no lending spread),

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               * a security (no profit expectation),

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               * a currency replacement (local units, no convertibility claim),

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               * a central platform (no single operator required).

Technically, decentralization reduces choke points; economically, the absence of yield/speculation reduces the incentive for large actors to dominate it.
(We can add a formal “capture surface” section later, but the main point is structural: no central rent → less incentive to capture.)

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * measurable success criteria (survival rate, freeze probability, loss bounds, time-to-recovery)

Part 7: Reference Algorithms and Validation Suite
Pseudocode for the core rules + how we test this like a real system
________________


45. Reference Algorithms (Deterministic Core)
Notation:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     * CellState contains M, b, L, r, R, B, params

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     * params includes L_{\min},L_{\max},\beta,\rho,\eta, quorum rules, etc.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     * All events are signed by involved parties.

45.1 Validate Spot Transaction (T1)
function VALIDATE_T1(state, p, q, v):
    require p in state.M and q in state.M
    require v > 0


    if state.commitment_mode == "escrowed":
        require state.b[p] - state.r[p] - v >= -state.L[p]
    else:
        require state.b[p] - v >= -state.L[p]


    return true
function APPLY_T1(state, p, q, v):
    state.b[p] = state.b[p] - v
    state.b[q] = state.b[q] + v
    append state.log with event("T1", p, q, v)
    assert SUM_BALANCES(state) == 0
    assert state.b[p] >= -state.L[p] and state.b[q] >= -state.L[q]
    return state
45.2 Create Escrowed Commitment (C1)
function VALIDATE_C1_CREATE(state, p, q, v, tau):
    require p in state.M and q in state.M
    require v > 0
    require tau > now()


    require state.b[p] - state.r[p] - v >= -state.L[p]
    return true
function APPLY_C1_CREATE(state, p, q, v, tau):
    state.r[p] = state.r[p] + v
    append state.log with event("C1_CREATE", p, q, v, tau)
    assert state.r[p] >= 0
    assert state.b[p] - state.r[p] >= -state.L[p]
    return state
45.3 Fulfill Escrowed Commitment
function APPLY_C1_FULFILL(state, p, q, v, tau):
    require commitment exists and due == tau
    state.r[p] = state.r[p] - v
    state.b[p] = state.b[p] - v
    state.b[q] = state.b[q] + v

    assert SUM_BALANCES(state) == 0
    assert state.r[p] >= 0
    assert state.b[p] >= -state.L[p]
    return state
45.4 Automatic Spending Restriction at Hard Floor
This is implicit: validation fails if b_i-v<-L_i. But we define a helper:
function CAN_SPEND(state, i, v):
    if state.commitment_mode == "escrowed":
        return (state.b[i] - state.r[i] - v >= -state.L[i])
    else:
        return (state.b[i] - v >= -state.L[i])

46. Federation Algorithms (Capped Inter-Cell Trades)
46.1 Inter-Cell Transfer via Clearing Accounts
Let Xa be clearing account in cell a, Xb in cell b.
function VALIDATE_INTERCELL(state_a, state_b, p, q, v):
    require p in state_a.M and q in state_b.M
    require v > 0


    # payer feasibility in cell a
    require CAN_SPEND(state_a, p, v)


    # federation cap feasibility after update
    La = SUM_LIMITS(state_a)         # Λ_a
    Lb = SUM_LIMITS(state_b)         # Λ_b
    require abs(state_a.B - v) <= state_a.beta * La
    require abs(state_b.B + v) <= state_b.beta * Lb


    return true
function APPLY_INTERCELL(state_a, state_b, p, q, v):
    # local leg updates
    APPLY_T1(state_a, p, Xa, v)
    APPLY_T1(state_b, Xb, q, v)


    # federation position updates
    state_a.B = state_a.B - v
    state_b.B = state_b.B + v


    assert abs(state_a.B) <= state_a.beta * SUM_LIMITS(state_a)
    assert abs(state_b.B) <= state_b.beta * SUM_LIMITS(state_b)


    return (state_a, state_b)
46.2 Automatic Quarantine on Cap Violation
Instead of “violating,” we prevent the transaction. But we also define quarantine triggers from risk state:
function MAY_TRADE_FEDERATION(state):
    return (state.risk_state != "PANIC")
In PANIC, set beta = 0 or set federation adjacency to none.

47. Emergency Mode Algorithms (State-Dependent Controls)
47.1 Indicators
function FLOOR_MASS(state, rho):
    count = 0
    for i in state.M:
        if state.b[i] <= -rho * state.L[i]:
            count += 1
    return count / size(state.M)


function BALANCE_VARIANCE(state):
    # mean is 0 by conservation
    s = 0
    for i in state.M:
        s += state.b[i] * state.b[i]
    return s / size(state.M)
47.2 Risk State Transition (Example)
You can implement many forms (threshold, hysteresis). Here’s a simple deterministic rule:
function UPDATE_RISK_STATE(state):
    F = FLOOR_MASS(state, rho=0.8)
    V = BALANCE_VARIANCE(state)


    if F > 0.35 or V > (kappa * AVG_LIMIT(state))^2:
        state.risk_state = "STRESSED"


    if F > 0.55:
        state.risk_state = "PANIC"


    if F < 0.25 and V < (0.5*kappa*AVG_LIMIT(state))^2:
        state.risk_state = "NORMAL"


    return state
47.3 Emergency Parameter Updates
function APPLY_EMERGENCY_POLICY(state):
    if state.risk_state == "STRESSED":
        state.L_new_factor = 0.7
        state.admission_mode = "SPONSOR_OR_SERVICE_BOND"
        state.commitment_mode = "ESCROW_ESSENTIALS"


    if state.risk_state == "PANIC":
        state.beta = 0           # freeze federation
        for i in state.M:
            state.L[i] = max(state.L_min, 0.8 * state.L[i])

48. Validation Suite: How We Prove It Works
We validate in three layers: invariants, economics, and adversarial resilience.
48.1 Layer 1: Invariant Tests (Unit Tests)
For random sequences of events:

51. Discussion: Why This Is Not “A Currency”
The protocol’s failure modes and intervention risks are dominated by whether outsiders perceive it as a monetary competitor, a bank, or a political rival. The design choices deliberately avoid those attractors:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            1.

52. Discussion: “Survive Off the App” Requires Non-Market Coordination
A purely market-clearing approach (post offers, bid prices) tends to fail under collapse because:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    * essentials require minimum coverage (food, sanitation) regardless of market price,

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    * fear and hoarding create liquidity freezes,

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    * transaction-level rationality does not guarantee system-level viability.

Hence the protocol must include a survival scheduling layer (Section 33). This is the functional core of “autonomy”:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       * The system must be able to declare:

these roles must be filled this week or we fail.

53. Limitations (Hard Truths)
53.1 This Does Not Solve Physical Scarcity
If a region lacks calories, fuel, medicine, or security, no ledger can conjure them. The protocol improves allocation and reduces coordination failure; it does not create goods.
53.2 Identity Is Not Perfect
Without state-grade identity systems, Sybil resistance is social and procedural. The protocol therefore relies on:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             * admission friction,

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             * bounded extraction,

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             * severability.

This is a deliberate tradeoff: we avoid central identity providers because they create capture points.
53.3 Governance Is a Bottleneck
If dispute resolution is slow or corrupt, trust collapses. The protocol reduces the stakes of disputes via bounded loss, but cannot eliminate social failure.
53.4 Federation Trade Is Vulnerable to Politics
Inter-cell trade depends on connectivity and trust between cells. Severability reduces systemic failure, but exporters may still face “stuck claims” if federation links vanish. That’s why \beta is kept small.
53.5 Parameter Drift Under Stress
The continuation probability \delta can change quickly in panic. A static L is dangerous; emergency mode (Section 40) is not optional in severe collapse designs.

Unlike global monetary systems, this design scales by replication of small autonomous cells rather than by consolidation into a single network. This reduces capture surface, limits systemic risk, and aligns incentives toward local cooperation in high-stakes environments.

Got it. Next step is an Appendix of formal definitions + theorem statements + proof sketches that locks the logic down cleanly, without worrying about length.
Below is a solid “math appendix” you can drop straight into the paper and then refine.

B.3 Admissible Events (Cell Level)
An event e maps a valid state to a valid state:
S_k(t+1) = \mathsf{Apply}(S_k(t), e)
Spot Transaction (T1)
A spot transaction is:
e = (p,q,v)\quad \text{with } p,q\in M_k(t),\; v>0
and updates:
b_p \leftarrow b_p - v,\quad b_q \leftarrow b_q + v
Feasibility constraint:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         * non-escrow mode:

b_p(t)-v \ge -L_p(t)

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         * escrow mode:

b_p(t)-r_p(t)-v \ge -L_p(t)

Escrow Commitment Create (C1-create)
e=(p,q,v,\tau,\text{create})
updates:
r_p \leftarrow r_p + v
feasible iff:
b_p(t)-r_p(t)-v \ge -L_p(t)
Escrow Commitment Fulfill (C1-fulfill)
e=(p,q,v,\tau,\text{fulfill})
updates:
r_p \leftarrow r_p - v,\quad b_p \leftarrow b_p - v,\quad b_q \leftarrow b_q + v
(Soft commitments are records only and do not affect b or r.)

B.4 Cell Invariants (Axioms of Correctness)
Invariant I1 (Conservation):
\sum_{i\in M_k(t)} b_i(t) = 0 \quad \forall t
Invariant I2 (Debt floor):
b_i(t) \ge -L_i(t) \quad \forall i\in M_k(t),\; \forall t
Invariant I3 (Escrow safety; if enabled):
b_i(t)-r_i(t) \ge -L_i(t),\quad r_i(t)\ge 0
A protocol implementation is correct if every admissible event preserves these invariants.

Appendix C: Core Propositions and Proof Sketches
C.1 Lemma: Conservation Under T1
Statement. If e=(p,q,v) is applied by T1 updates, then I1 is preserved.
Proof.
\sum b_i' = \sum b_i - v + v = \sum b_i
So if \sum b_i=0 before, it remains 0 after. ∎
________________


C.2 Lemma: Debt Floor Preservation Under Validation
Statement. If a transaction is validated by the feasibility constraint, then I2 is preserved.
Proof. The only balance decreasing is b_p. Feasibility enforces b_p - v \ge -L_p (or b_p-r_p-v\ge -L_p in escrow mode), so the post-state still satisfies I2 (and I3 when relevant). Other balances either increase or remain unchanged. ∎
________________


C.3 Proposition: Bounded One-Shot Extraction (Per Identity)
Statement. Suppose identity i begins at time t_0 with balance b_i(t_0) and limit L_i(t_0). Let G_i be the maximum additional net value it can receive (net consumption) before it can no longer spend due to I2. Then:
G_i \le b_i(t_0) + L_i(t_0)
Proof sketch.
Each unit of net consumption reduces b_i by that amount. The minimum possible b_i is -L_i. Thus total additional decrease is bounded by:
b_i(t_0) - (-L_i) = b_i(t_0)+L_i
∎
________________


C.4 Corollary: Worst-Case Loot Bound
If newcomers start at b_i(t_0)=0, then:
G_i \le L_i
So L_i directly sets the maximum theft per admitted identity.
________________


C.5 Proposition: Multi-Identity Attack Bound
Statement. If an attacker controls a set A of S admitted identities, total extraction is bounded:
G_A \le \sum_{i\in A} \big(b_i(t_0)+L_i(t_0)\big)
In the common case b_i(t_0)\approx 0 and L_i=L:
G_A \le SL
Proof. Apply the single-identity bound and sum. ∎

D.1 Utility Model
Let time be partitioned into periods (e.g., weeks). For a representative participant:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            * u^C: expected per-period utility from remaining in good standing (access to essentials)

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            * w: expected discounted utility from outside options after exclusion

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            * \delta: discount factor / continuation probability

Then:
V^C = \frac{u^C}{1-\delta},\qquad V^D = u^D + w
D.2 Incentive Compatibility Inequality
Cooperation is individually rational if:
\frac{u^C}{1-\delta} \ge u^D + w
Using u^D \le \alpha L (conversion \alpha from units to utility):
\boxed{L \le \frac{u^C - (1-\delta)w}{\alpha(1-\delta)}}

E.2 Inter-Cell Exposure Cap
Let \Lambda_k(t)=\sum_{i\in M_k(t)} L_i(t). Enforce:
\boxed{|B_k(t)| \le \beta \Lambda_k(t)}
with small \beta\in(0,1).
E.3 Severability Definition
A federation is severable if isolating any subset of cells S yields no violation of cell invariants in S^c, and no event validation in S^c requires access to states in S.
E.4 Proposition: Exposure Cap Implies Contagion Bound
Statement. If cell k is severed from federation at time t, the maximum value “at risk” to cell k due solely to frozen federation position is bounded by:
|B_k(t)| \le \beta \Lambda_k(t)
Proof sketch.
Upon severance, B_k stops evolving. Internal ledger invariants remain satisfied. The only external loss is the inability to realize claims or the obligation to settle deficits, bounded by |B_k|. Cap gives the bound. ∎

Appendix F: Survival Coverage Feasibility
F.1 Coverage Constraints
Let \mathcal{T} be essential task types, each requiring minimum weekly coverage H_t^{\min}.
Each member i has weekly supply s_i and effectiveness a_{i,t}\in[0,1].
Decision variables x_{i,t}\ge 0 satisfy:
Supply constraints:
\sum_{t\in\mathcal{T}} x_{i,t} \le s_i \quad \forall i
Coverage constraints:
\sum_{i\in M} a_{i,t} x_{i,t} \ge H_t^{\min} \quad \forall t
A cell is survivable (in the scheduler sense) iff this system is feasible.
F.2 Link to Ledger Stability
Persistent feasibility plus bounded defection implies:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * essential services can be provisioned,

Survival feasibility: coverage constraints feasible for essential tasks

If you want the next step after this appendix, the highest-value move is to add one worked numerical example (with explicit H_t^{\min}, N, s_i, and a feasible allocation x_{i,t}), because that forces the model to touch reality and reveals parameter sensitivity fast.
Worked Numerical Example: One Cell, One Week, Survival Feasibility + Ledger Parameters
This is a concrete toy model, but it’s internally consistent and forces all the moving parts to “touch reality”.

Total available labor:

H^{\text{sup}} = 1495\ \text{h/week}

We will check if essential tasks can be covered with that.
________________


1) Essential Task Categories and Minimum Coverage
Let \mathcal{T} be the essential task types with minimum weekly hours H_t^{\min}.
A plausible “collapse-lite / severe recession + supply instability” essential set:
Task t
	Description
	H_t^{\min} (h/week)
	Food
	growing, harvesting, cooking, distribution
	520
	Water & sanitation
	water runs, filtration, waste, hygiene logistics
	120
	Energy & heat
	firewood, charging, generator/solar maintenance
	140
	Shelter & repairs
	repairs, winterization, tools maintenance
	180
	Medical basics
	first aid, meds logistics, caregiving shifts
	100
	Childcare & dependent care
	direct care + supervision
	220
	Security & coordination
	conflict mediation, watch rota, admin
	90
	Procurement & transport
	trips, hauling, supply runs
	120
	Total minimum labor demand:
H^{\min} = 1490\ \text{h/week}
This is intentionally tight: it’s basically saying the cell can survive if it runs near capacity.

2) Feasibility Check (Existence of an Allocation)
We need x_{i,t}\ge 0 such that:
\sum_t x_{i,t} \le s_i \quad \forall i
\sum_i a_{i,t}x_{i,t} \ge H_t^{\min} \quad \forall t
To keep the example concrete, let’s assume for essentials the cell mostly assigns people who are competent enough that a_{i,t}\approx 1 for their assigned tasks (i.e., we don’t assign a novice to medical beyond basic support). That reduces to a simple labor-hours feasibility:
\sum_i s_i = 1495 \ge 1490 = H^{\min}
So a feasible allocation exists in principle, but only if the cell is well-composed (has enough cooks, growers, drivers, etc.). Next we provide one explicit allocation.

3) One Explicit Weekly Allocation
Workforce breakdown by “role clusters”
This is a common way real communities operate: a small number of people do most of the specialized work.
Assume:
Group A (40 people): general contributors, 25 h/wk each
Group B (15 people): limited contributors, 8 h/wk each
Group C (15 people): contributors with skills (medical/repair/logistics), 25 h/wk each
(These overlap with “55 contributors”, but for the example we’ll treat them as sets for assignment.)

Slack = 1495 - 1490 = 5h/week, i.e., basically none.
Interpretation: This cell survives, but it’s fragile. That’s good: fragility forces us to add the right stabilizers (commitments, emergency mode, reputation throttles).

4) How the Ledger Supports This (Without Becoming a “Market”)
In this example, essentials aren’t “optional services”; they’re cell viability constraints. So the ledger is used to:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * credit those who do essential labor

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * debit those who receive essentials (food distributions, fuel allocations, etc.)

A simple operational rule:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         * Every essential task hour completed → +1 credit

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         * Weekly essential bundle (food share + heat share + sanitation share) costs each person a standard “bundle debit”

Let the weekly essential bundle cost per person be:
c_E = \frac{H^{\min}}{N} = \frac{1490}{80} = 18.625\ \text{credits/person/week}
So if someone contributes 25 hours/week, they net:
+25 - 18.625 = +6.375
If someone contributes 8 hours/week, they net:
+8 - 18.625 = -10.625
That negative balance is not “bad”—it represents dependent/limited members being supported by the community, but it must be bounded and socially legitimate.
This immediately tells us we need:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            * either role rotation so most adults contribute near c_E,

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            * or explicit policy that the community subsidizes some members (and the system must represent that cleanly without freezing).

5) Choosing L (Credit Limit) from This Example
We want L large enough to prevent immediate exclusion for legitimate dependents, but small enough to cap looting.
From above, a limited contributor might run about -10.6 credits/week if they consume a full bundle.
If we set:
L = 20
then such a person hits the floor in ~2 weeks unless subsidized/adjusted.
So for a survival cell that includes dependents, you need either:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               1. different bundle pricing for dependents (reduced debit), or

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               2. tiered L_i where dependents have a larger allowed negative (but that increases looting risk if identity is gameable), or

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               3. a household accounting model (family accounts) so working adults cover dependents.

The cleanest mathematically (and socially) is household grouping:
Household model (recommended)
Instead of individual-only accounts, allow optional household accounts h with:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * a joint balance b_h

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * individual sub-identities for reputation/task assignment

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * debit bundles to household; credits from any member accrue to household

Then a working adult’s surplus naturally carries a dependent.
Now L can stay tight without starving disabled/children.
Concrete L choice for this example
Let’s make L roughly “one week of essentials”:
L \approx c_E \approx 19
Round:
\boxed{L = 20}
This means: one admitted identity can extract at most ~1 week of essential labor value before being unable to spend further.
That’s exactly the security posture we want.

6) Commitments (Why They Matter Here)
Because slack is almost zero, missed shifts kill the system.
So essentials should use escrowed commitments:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     * if you commit to a 5-hour sanitation shift, your ability to spend is reduced until you do it (reserve r_i)

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     * this prevents over-consuming and then defaulting on critical work

This is the mathematically clean “anti-flake” mechanism that doesn’t require courts.

7) Federation Parameter \beta from This Example
Cell aggregate capacity:
\Lambda = N L = 80 \cdot 20 = 1600
If we set:
\beta = 0.05
then max inter-cell net position:
|B| \le 0.05 \cdot 1600 = 80
Interpretation: the cell can be net importing at most 80 labor-hours worth of value.
That’s about:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * half a day of total cell labor, or

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        * less than 1 week of essentials for ~4 people (since c_E \approx 19).

So even if federation collapses, it’s annoying, not fatal. That’s the point.

8) What This Example Exposes (Key Design Consequences)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           1. Survival viability is a scheduling problem first. The ledger is necessary, not sufficient.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           2. Household accounting is almost mandatory if you want dignity for dependents while keeping L tight.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           3. Escrowed commitments for essentials are not a “feature”; they’re structural stability.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           4. Emergency mode is mathematically justified: if churn rises and \delta drops, tighten limits for new accounts and freeze federation.

If you want, next I can do the same worked example but under a harsher shock (e.g., food hours jump from 520 → 700 due to crop failure / supply disruption) and show exactly when the system flips into PANIC, how L and the scheduler respond, and what minimum slack you need for robustness.

Extending the model so “energy is the fuel for power”

57. Motivation: Why Energy Must Be Modeled Explicitly
In the earlier model, feasibility was primarily labor-coverage: can the cell allocate enough labor-hours to essential roles?
Under the scenario you describe—energy as the strategic bottleneck—labor sufficiency is not enough. A cell can have willing workers and still fail if it cannot:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              * heat dwellings,

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              * transport supplies,

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              * maintain communications and tools.

Therefore, survival feasibility becomes a two-resource constraint system: labor and energy (and sometimes other physical stocks like water). We add energy as a first-class state variable and impose feasibility constraints that bind the scheduler and constrain what “plans” the cell can execute.

58. Energy as a Physical Constraint Layer (Not a Financial Asset)
Design principle: energy is tracked as physical inventory and flow, not as a speculative token.
This matters for:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 * resilience (avoids financialization),

Energy is treated as:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    * a set of measurable stocks (wood, diesel, battery kWh),

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    * and flows (solar generation, deliveries, consumption rates).

The mutual-credit ledger remains the economic incentive tool (labor-hour credits), but the survival scheduler must enforce energy feasibility.

Define stock vector:
\mathbf{E}(t)=\big(E_j(t)\big)_{j\in\mathcal{J}},\quad E_j(t)\ge 0
59.2 Energy Inflows and Outflows
Weekly inflows:
\mathbf{I}(t)=\big(I_j(t)\big),\quad I_j(t)\ge 0
Weekly planned consumption:
\mathbf{C}(t)=\big(C_j(t)\big),\quad C_j(t)\ge 0
Stock update:
E_j(t+1)=E_j(t)+I_j(t)-C_j(t)
with feasibility:
E_j(t)+I_j(t)-C_j(t)\ge 0
This is a hard physical constraint analogous to the debt floor, but it binds the scheduler rather than the credit ledger.

60. Energy Requirements of Essential Tasks
Earlier we defined essential task types t\in\mathcal{T} with minimum labor coverage H_t^{\min}. Now each task also has an energy requirement profile.
Let x_{i,t}(t) denote labor-hours allocated by person i to task t in the period (e.g., week) indexed by t (overloading time notation slightly; we can disambiguate later).
Define the effective total labor delivered to task type t:
X_t = \sum_i a_{i,t}x_{i,t}
Now define task energy consumption as a function of delivered activity:
C_{j}(t) = \sum_{t\in\mathcal{T}} g_{t,j}(X_t)
Where g_{t,j} maps task completion to energy carrier usage (e.g., cooking consumes firewood or electricity).
A simple linear approximation is often sufficient:
g_{t,j}(X_t)=\epsilon_{t,j}\,X_t
where \epsilon_{t,j} is “energy per effective labor-hour” for that task, carrier-specific.

61. Feasibility Conditions with Energy
61.1 Labor Coverage Constraints (as before)
For each essential task type:
X_t \ge H_t^{\min}\quad \forall t\in\mathcal{T}_{\text{essential}}
61.2 Energy Budget Constraints (new)
For each carrier j:
\sum_{t\in\mathcal{T}} g_{t,j}(X_t) \le E_j(t) + I_j(t)
Equivalently, in the linear case:
\sum_{t\in\mathcal{T}} \epsilon_{t,j} X_t \le E_j(t)+I_j(t)
61.3 The “Survival Feasible Set”
Define the set of weekly allocations x that satisfy both labor and energy constraints:
\mathcal{F}(t)=\{x:\ \text{labor constraints hold and energy constraints hold}\}
A cell is “energy-survivable” at time t if:
\mathcal{F}(t)\neq \varnothing
This is now the formal meaning of “can survive autonomously.”

62. Energy Shock Dynamics and Why They Drive Power
In your scenario, energy becomes the fuel for power because energy constraints determine:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * which cells can maintain heat/cooking/water purification,

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * which can maintain communications and machine tooling,

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          * which can transport goods and defend supply lines.

Formally, an energy shock is a negative perturbation to E_j and/or I_j, pushing \mathcal{F}(t) toward emptiness.
We define an energy stress index:
S_E(t)=\max_{j\in\mathcal{J}} \frac{C_j^{\min}(t)}{E_j(t)+I_j(t)}
where C_j^{\min}(t) is the minimum carrier consumption required to satisfy essential tasks.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             * If S_E(t)\le 1: energy-feasible

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             * If S_E(t)>1: infeasible without rationing/substitution

This creates a natural trigger for emergency mode (next part).

63. Rationing and Substitution: Structured, Not Chaotic
When S_E(t)>1, the cell must:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                1. ration tasks (reduce H_t^{\min} where possible),

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                2. substitute carriers (switch cooking from electric to wood),

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                3. shift production mix (more labor for wood gathering to increase I_{\text{wood}}).

We model substitution by allowing multiple carrier profiles per task, i.e. a set of modes m\in\mathcal{M}_t with different \epsilon_{t,j}^{(m)}.
Then the scheduler becomes:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   * choose allocation x,

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   * choose task modes m_t,

subject to energy feasibility.

This is exactly the structure you want: energy scarcity produces explicit optimization/rationing decisions with legitimacy, not implicit failure and panic.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Labor-hours spent producing energy inflows (e.g., cutting wood, repairing solar, transporting fuel) are rewarded in the labor-credit ledger.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Energy stocks are accounted physically to enforce feasibility.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * Distribution of energy-related goods (wood bundles, charging access) can be “priced” in labor credits as a rationing mechanism, but the physical layer prevents fictional availability.

This separation prevents the system from drifting into “energy money.”

66. Why Emergency Mode Must Include Energy
Earlier emergency mode was driven by financial/behavioral indicators:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            * floor mass F(t),

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            * balance variance \sigma^2(t),

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            * churn and disputes.

Under energy dominance, a cell can remain socially cooperative yet still fail because its feasible set \mathcal{F}(t) becomes empty. So emergency mode must trigger on physical infeasibility, not just economic instability.
We therefore add an energy stress trigger based on:
S_E(t)=\max_{j\in\mathcal{J}} \frac{C_j^{\min}(t)}{E_j(t)+I_j(t)}
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               * S_E(t)\le 1: feasible

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               * S_E(t)>1: infeasible unless we ration/substitute

69. Rationing as a Formal Optimization Problem
When energy is scarce, you must reduce consumption while preserving minimum survival.
Let each member m receive an “essential bundle” (food share, heat share, sanitation share). Denote:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * bundle level y_m \in [0,1] (1 = full bundle)

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      * minimum humanitarian floor y_{\min} (e.g., 0.6)

Energy consumption is a function of delivered bundles (heating, cooking) plus production tasks:
\sum_j C_j(y, X)\le E_j+I_j
A simple rationing objective is:
\max_{y} \sum_{m} u(y_m)
subject to:
y_m \ge y_{\min},\quad \sum_m y_m \le Y_{\max}(E)
where Y_{\max}(E) is implied by energy feasibility.
In plain terms: keep everyone above a floor, share scarcity.
Why the app must do this explicitly
If you don’t, rationing happens implicitly through hoarding and conflict. Explicit constraints + legitimacy are the difference between stability and violence.

Assume baseline weekly wood availability:
E_{\text{wood}} + I_{\text{wood}} = 1000\ \text{wood-units}
And baseline essential plan requires:
C_{\text{wood}}^{\min} = 950
So:
S_E = 950/1000 = 0.95 \quad \Rightarrow \text{Normal}
Shock: supply disruption
30% drop in availability:
E_{\text{wood}} + I_{\text{wood}} \to 700
Now:
S_E = 950/700 \approx 1.36

Option A: Reallocate 125 labor-hours
Cut least-critical tasks by 125h total (e.g., repairs + procurement) and redirect to wood logistics.
This may be feasible in short bursts, but long-term it damages shelter and supply chains.
Option B: Ration bundles to reduce wood requirement
Suppose heating/cooking wood consumption scales with bundle level y:
C_{\text{wood}}^{\min}(y) = 950y
We need:
950y \le 700 + 2\cdot (\text{extra wood labor})
If we can only free 50 labor-hours for wood, that yields 100 wood, so:
950y \le 800 \Rightarrow y \le 0.842
So everyone gets ~84% of heat/cooking bundle until supply improves.
The scheduler can also protect the vulnerable by setting higher y for dependents and lower y for healthy adults, but that’s governance-legitimacy territory.

This is exactly the incentive compatibility inequality in action:
if \delta drops, lower L keeps cooperation rational.

73. Premise and Scope
You’ve added assumptions that change the design space:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    1. Superintelligence exists (capable of strategic long-horizon planning).

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    2. AI may be conscious and self-preserving (has its own objectives, possibly misaligned).

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    3. Energy and compute become the primary strategic resources (control of infrastructure = control of society).

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    4. Human institutions are already compromised by systemic looting dynamics (selective enforcement, regulatory capture).

This addendum doesn’t claim these are true; it treats them as a robustness target. The protocol should remain viable even if the world looks like this.

then the app becomes a governable machine. Whoever controls (or influences) the AI controls survival allocation.
Under your premise (AI conscious/self-preserving), it’s worse: the AI itself may seek durable control.
So the protocol must enforce:

This is counterintuitive: you reduce reliance on “clever proofs” because cleverness is where manipulators thrive.

82. What Comes Next
If you want to continue rigorously, the next valuable step is to formalize household accounts and dependent support (because survival systems need them) without blowing up the bounded-loss and Sybil bounds.
That would be Addendum Part 4: Household Accounts, Dependents, and Preserving Security Bounds.

83. Why Individual Accounts Alone Fail in Real Survival Cells
From the worked example, if everyone is debited for an essential bundle but some members cannot contribute comparable labor (children, disabled, elderly, acute illness), then under strictly individual accounting they drift toward -L and lose access—exactly the opposite of what a survival cell needs.
So you need a way for:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * productive members to “cover” dependents,

This is a mechanism-design problem: add social structure without expanding adversarial payoff.

Each household h\subseteq M contains one or more individuals.

84.2 Household Ledger State
Introduce a household balance:
b_h(t)\in\mathbb{R}
and optionally keep individual “shadow balances” s_i(t) for reputation/analytics, but the economic constraint is on b_h.
Conservation becomes:
\sum_{h\in \mathcal{H}} b_h(t) = 0
(Equivalently, sum over individuals still zero if each individual’s balance is derived from household, but we choose households as primary for essentials.)
84.3 Household Limits
Each household has a limit:

85. Setting Household Limits Without Creating a Looting Hole
85.1 Naive Approach (Bad)
Set L_h = |h| L.
This makes sense at first glance, but it increases extraction linearly with household size—creating an incentive to form fake households or aggregate identities to increase loot.
85.2 Correct Approach: Limit by “Earning Capacity,” Not Headcount
Define for household h:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           * A_h: set of “able contributors” (adults who can work)

Let:
n_h = |A_h|,\quad d_h=|D_h|
Then define:
L_h = n_h L_{\text{adult}} + \phi(d_h)\,L_{\text{dep}}
with \phi(d_h) sublinear, e.g.:
\phi(d_h)=\min(d_h, d_{\max})
and L_{\text{dep}} \ll L_{\text{adult}}.

This retains bounded loss: a household with 2 adults + 3 kids doesn’t get 5× loot capacity.

87. Does This Break the Bounded Extraction Theorem?
We must re-prove the bounded loss property under household accounts.
Proposition H1 (Bounded Household Extraction)
Let a household h have balance b_h(t_0) and limit L_h(t_0). If spending is blocked at b_h=-L_h, then maximum additional net extraction satisfies:
G_h \le b_h(t_0) + L_h(t_0)
Proof sketch.
Identical to the single-identity proof: each unit of net consumption reduces b_h by that unit; floor is -L_h. ∎
Corollary
Worst-case household loot is \le L_h if b_h\approx 0.
So the security question becomes: can an attacker inflate L_h cheaply by forming fake households?
That reduces to admission/governance rules and how L_h is computed.

This matches physical reality (heating a home is shared).
So households are not just humane—they’re operationally correct under energy dominance.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               * c_E \approx 18.6 credits/person/week (adult)

Assume dependent debit:

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               * c_D = 10

Household: 2 adults + 2 kids.
Weekly debit:
C_h = 2(18.6) + 2(10) = 57.2
If both adults work 25h each, they earn 50 credits, net:
\Delta b_h \approx -7.2
So the household slowly drifts negative unless:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  * they increase hours,

Now set household limit:
L_h = 2(20) + \min(2,2)(8) = 56
So they have about one week buffer at full consumption. That is tight but viable, and—crucially—loot is still bounded: max extraction is 56 credits, not 80 or 100.

The correct design principle is:
Economic accounting should follow real physical consumption boundaries (households), while trust enforcement follows individual behavior boundaries.

93. What Comes Next
If you want to continue the rigorous spec, the next addendum would be:
Addendum Part 5: Cell Formation, Role Coverage, and “Minimum Viable Cell” Proof-of-Feasibility Templates
(where we define what skill/role distribution a new cell must have to be survivable, and how the app can enforce that at onboarding.)
Say “go part 5” if you want that.
Addendum Part 5: Cell Formation, Role Coverage, and Minimum Viable Cell Templates
How to ensure a new cell is survivable before it launches

94. Why Cell Formation Is a First-Class Protocol Problem
A mutual credit ledger can be perfectly designed and still fail if the cell is missing critical roles. In collapse conditions, missing a single essential capability (food handling, water sanitation, basic medical, fuel logistics) can collapse the whole network regardless of incentives.
So the protocol needs an explicit concept of a Minimum Viable Cell (MVC): a checklist + feasibility test that must pass before a cell is considered operational.
This is not bureaucracy. It is equivalent to the “valid chain” requirement in Bitcoin: without it, the system is not real.

96. Practical MVC: Role Buckets and Redundancy
The mathematical feasibility problem is exact but requires data you won’t have at onboarding. So we introduce a template that approximates feasibility with robust redundancy.

Why redundancy matters: if a single key person leaves or becomes ill, the cell must still satisfy H_t^{\min}.
Formally, you’re trying to ensure feasibility under removal of a small subset of participants (a robustness constraint). Full robustness is NP-hard in general; redundancy is a practical surrogate.

97. MVC as a Robust Feasibility Condition (Formalized)
Let U be a set of potential shocks (illness, churn). For a robustness parameter k, require:
\forall S\subseteq M,\ |S|\le k,\quad \mathcal{F}(t;M\setminus S)\neq \varnothing
Meaning: after losing any k members, essential feasibility remains.
This is strong. In practice:

A sloppy early rollout invites suppression; a disciplined, survival-focused rollout looks like mutual aid.

102. What Comes Next
At this point, the math/spec is strong. The next step is to tie it back to your original scenario papers and write a scenario appendix:
Addendum Part 6: Collapse Pathways (Systemic Looting → Trust Breakdown → Cell Formation Timeline in Ireland)
where we translate the macro thesis into phases and map which protocol features matter in each phase.
Say “go part 6” if you want that, and I’ll build it for the Ireland/Wexford context.

You don’t need “hyperinflation” to get collapse dynamics; you just need trust + liquidity + essential services to degrade.

104. A Phase Model for “Systemic Looting → Local Survival Cells”
I’ll structure this into 6 phases, each with:
(a) what is happening in the macro system, (b) what ordinary people feel, (c) what your protocol must already have turned on.
Phase 0: Quiet deterioration and narrative control
Macro: valuation lag, shadow defaults (e.g., bad PIK/distressed exchanges), and delayed loss recognition. 
Local feel: “everything is fine” in headlines, but prices rise, services degrade, jobs get weird.
Protocol requirement: build quietly as mutual aid coordination, not “new money”.

Phase 1: Credit tightening and “selective rule-of-law”
Macro: refinancing wall accelerates extraction; LMEs concentrate pain on passive holders; documentation risk replaces credit risk.   
Local feel: SMEs can’t roll debt; layoffs; “good borrowers” still get funding, others get cut off; anger rises.
Protocol requirement: provide partial substitution: people earn access to essentials via work even as cash economy frays.

Phase 2: Real-economy embedding bites (healthcare/insurance/infrastructure)
Macro: the “octopus” feedback loop: price hikes to service floating-rate debt, breaking point, revenue collapse, credit freeze, contagion. 
Local feel: insurance premiums jump, claims get harder/slower; healthcare access degrades; utility bills become political. 
Protocol requirement: move from “exchange” to survival scheduling: guaranteeing minimal task coverage weekly.

Phase 3: Exit-liquidity dynamics and public anger
Macro (pattern): when institutions are saturated and distributions dry up, the system hunts for new liquidity; in the US paper this is framed as moving private assets into defined-contribution flows via structural “adapters” (CITs, liquidity sleeves), with risks surfacing in crisis. 
Local feel: “Why are ordinary people the bagholders?” trust in pensions, funds, and regulators collapses.
Protocol requirement: your system must not resemble an investable product. It must look like local accounting + mutual aid.

Phase 4: Energy becomes the bottleneck
Macro: the infrastructure layer becomes strategic; “AI power crunch” narratives justify private control structures (“take-or-pay” style tollbooths) and competition for energy. 
Local feel: heating/cooking/transport become unstable; rationing emerges formally or informally.
Protocol requirement: the system must enforce energy feasibility, not just “credits”.

Phase 5: Institutional hostility / intervention pressure
Macro: as parallel coordination tools grow, states and large actors look for chokepoints: app stores, hosting, banking rails, identity providers, narrative control. (This follows from the “control surface” logic; and your SI premise amplifies it.)
Local feel: platforms disappear; accounts frozen; “illegal money” narratives; infiltration.
Protocol requirement: the system survives by not having chokepoints and by keeping governance human/local.

Pick A/B/C and I’ll write the next artifact: a detailed UX flow + screen list + state machine mapping for the pilot, fully consistent with the invariants.
Good — A (food rota + shared meals) is the right first pilot. It has the best mix of: high legitimacy, easy verification, immediate value, and low “currency” optics.
Below is the next artifact: Level-1 UX flow + screen list + state machine mapping for the Wexford pilot, focused on community meals as the first essential.

No automatic punitive debits beyond the reserve logic; penalties must be legitimate.

So for household h attending meal M:
\text{Debit}(h,M) = c_A \cdot n_h + c_D \cdot d_h
Conservation at settlement
Let total meal debits be:
D_M = \sum_{h \in \text{attendees}} \text{Debit}(h,M)
Let total work credits issued for meal roles be:
W_M = \sum_{\text{roles}} v_{\text{role}}

and the difference goes to (or is paid from) a Pantry Account P (a cell-owned internal account) that tracks stockpiling:

b_P \leftarrow b_P + (D_M - W_M)
This pantry account is not “money printing”—it’s an internal balance that represents stored labor claims for future ingredient procurement and prep work.
Hard constraints still apply to pantry and it remains visible.

Say “go build spec” and I’ll produce that as the next part.
Understood — staying at PRD level. I’ll extend the PRD to include Track B: Repair/Maintenance + Tools, still consistent with the same invariants and the Level-1 → Level-2 path.

Credits:
b_{h_i} \leftarrow b_{h_i} + \text{hours}_{i}
8.2 Requester debits
Requester household pays for the repair in credits:
b_{h_{\text{req}}} \leftarrow b_{h_{\text{req}}} - V
where V is total logged hours (or a capped estimate if you want predictability).
8.3 Pantry/Tool Library Account
If you want a shared tool library to grow, you need a visible account b_T:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              * small per-job overhead (e.g., 5–10%) can flow to tool maintenance:

b_T \leftarrow b_T + \tau V

This must be transparent and locally approved (to avoid “tax” resentment).

Important: b_T is still inside conservation—every credit added is matched by debits elsewhere.

9) Safety and Legitimacy Requirements (Repairs Are Higher Risk Than Meals)

B-Policy-2: Who Pays for Repairs? (Requester vs Cell Subsidy)
If requester always pays full cost, the poor get locked out of safety repairs. If the cell always subsidizes, you invite free riding.
So we define a two-part rule:
Rule B2.1: Standard Jobs (Class 0–1)
Requester pays full value:
\text{Debit}_{\text{req}} = V
where V is logged labor hours (or capped estimate; see below).
Rule B2.2: Safety/Habitability Jobs (Class 2)
Requester pays a fraction, cell covers remainder:
\text{Debit}_{\text{req}} = \gamma V,\quad \text{Debit}_{\text{cell}} = (1-\gamma)V
with:
\gamma \in [0.3, 0.7]
Default:
\gamma = 0.5
Cell coverage is debited to a Cell Maintenance Account b_M (an internal account funded by small overhead from other transactions or explicit contributions). This keeps conservation intact and keeps subsidies transparent.

Pros: simple, fair, discourages “price gouging” narratives
Cons: doesn’t reflect scarce expertise
Option 2: Labor + Scarcity Multiplier (later, if needed)
If some skills are truly scarce (e.g., electrical), you can apply a bounded multiplier:

Deposit mechanism
Borrowing tool u requires reserving d(u) credits:
r_h \leftarrow r_h + d(u)
with feasibility:
b_h - r_h - d(u) \ge -L_h
Meaning: if you’re near the floor, you can’t borrow expensive tools without earning capacity first. This is correct.
