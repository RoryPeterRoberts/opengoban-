## Bug Fixes

### Task 1: Fix partial word matching in search
**Feedback:** #2 (Eamonn Parker), #3 (Eamonn Parker)
**Problem:** Searching "AI" matches "trails", "availability", "memorial" because the search does substring matching. Affects both the member directory search and the feed/listing search on the home page.
**Fix:** Switch to word-boundary matching. Use a regex `\b` word boundary or split the search term and match against whole words. Ensure case-insensitive.
**Files:** `index.html` (feed search), `directory.html` (member search)
**Status:** [x] Done — commit `c24d7d7`

### Task 2: Fix feedback FAB overlapping Send button
**Feedback:** #7 (Patrick Lambert), #10 (Eamonn Parker)
**Problem:** The green floating feedback button sits on top of the Send button inside the feedback modal itself, especially on mobile portrait. Makes it impossible to submit feedback.
**Fix:** Hide the feedback FAB when the feedback modal is open. Show it again when the modal closes.
**Files:** `index.html` (feedback modal open/close functions)
**Status:** [x] Done — commit `8d85e9d`

## Enhancements

### Task 3: Unsaved profile changes prompt
**Feedback:** #1 (Eamonn Parker)
**Problem:** Editing profile then navigating away loses changes silently.
**Fix:** Track whether the profile form has been modified (dirty flag). On back/navigate, if dirty, show a confirmation: "You have unsaved changes. Leave without saving?"
**Files:** `profile.html` (edit form, back navigation, beforeunload)
**Status:** [x] Done — commit `4a0ce87`

### Task 4: Move search box higher on home page
**Feedback:** #4 (Eamonn Parker)
**Problem:** The search box is below the feed tabs and filter controls, requiring scrolling to find it.
**Fix:** Move the search input above the "Community board" heading, immediately after quick links.
**Files:** `index.html` (feed section HTML layout)
**Status:** [x] Done — commit `1a79b5c`

### Task 5: Add back navigation on post success screen
**Feedback:** #5 (Eamonn Parker)
**Problem:** After posting an offer, a large "Posted" confirmation appears. The only way back is scrolling down to a button at the bottom.
**Fix:** Add a back arrow at the top of the success screen, consistent with other pages.
**Files:** `index.html` (post success view)
**Status:** [x] Done — commit `e762ec1`

### Task 6: Allow message when declining an exchange
**Feedback:** #6 (Patrick Lambert)
**Problem:** When declining a proposed exchange, there's no way to explain why. The proposer just sees "Declined" with no context.
**Fix:** Added optional reason input when declining. Stored in new `cancel_reason` column. Shown on cancelled exchange cards and in the notification to the proposer.
**Files:** `exchanges.html` (decline handler), `supabase.js` (cancelExchange with reason)
**Status:** [x] Done — commit `a6126c0`

### Task 7: Add feedback button to all pages
**Feedback:** #9 (Eamonn Parker)
**Problem:** The floating feedback button only appears on the main index.html page. Other pages (directory, exchanges, profile, etc.) don't have it.
**Fix:** Extracted feedback FAB and modal into shared `feedback-widget.js`. Added to all user-facing pages: directory, exchanges, listing, profile, connections, my-feedback.
**Files:** `feedback-widget.js` (new), `directory.html`, `exchanges.html`, `listing.html`, `profile.html`, `connections.html`, `my-feedback.html`
**Status:** [x] Done — commit `ca396ab`

## Roadmap Signals

### Task 8: Record Phase 1 signal — shared funds / pooled credits
**Feedback:** #8 (Rory)
**Message:** "Flag somewhere that the +5 credits everyone receives on joining will overtime slowly be moved to a pooled account, to cover group benefits, think beach cleaning."
**Roadmap:** Phase 1 — Cell Accounts (Welcome Account + Shared Funds)
**Action:** No code change now. This is the first member signal pointing toward Cell Accounts. Record it. When 2-3 more members ask about shared resources or pooling credits, it's time to build Phase 1.
**Status:** [x] Logged as roadmap signal
