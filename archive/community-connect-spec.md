# Community Connect

## Core Principle

**The Cell** — the fundamental unit of organization:

> A Cell is a bounded group of people where all members are peers, governance is symmetric by default, and no member has inherent authority over another.

**Everything else is configuration, not structure.**

---

## Reference Framework — Idea-to-Institution Lifecycle

The natural stages of how shared ideas become functioning communities:

| Stage | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 1. Private insight | Individual notices a problem/opportunity, forms rough idea |
| 2. Internal rehearsal | Sanity-check against goals, risks, identity: "Is this me? Is this worth pursuing?" |
| 3. Articulation | Compress into communicable form: short story, pitch, "why this matters" |
| 4. First social test (dyadic) | Share with 1–2 trusted people. Key output: *emotional and moral validation*, not logic |
| 5. Clarification / sharpening | Feedback forces specificity: scope, boundaries, next step |
| 6. Coalition formation | Small group forms. Joining signals alignment with core principles and shared identity |
| 7. Norm-setting | Coalition establishes "how we do things": rules, values, roles, what's in/out. Crucial for trust |
| 8. Commitment signals | Members invest something costly (time, reputation, effort). Reduces free-riding and fake alignment |
| 9. First implementation | Concrete action in the world. Creates proof, attracts others |
| 10. Replication / recruitment | Success stories spread. New members join through existing members (trust via social proof) |
| 11. Institutionalization | Practice becomes repeatable: routines, records, governance, enforcement, succession |
| 12. Legitimation | Wider community accepts it as "a real thing": name, status, social permission |
| 13. Scaling or fission | Growth leads to subgroups or cell splits to preserve trust |
| 14. Selection pressure | Competing variants emerge; what survives fits incentives, norms, local constraints |

## Decision 1 — Cell Structure Invariant

**Status:** Locked

### Statement

The system **only supports peer cells** at the protocol level.

A **Cell** is defined as:

> A bounded group of people where all members are peers, governance is symmetric by default, and no member has inherent authority over another.

### Implications

- Hierarchical structures (companies, employers, managers, owners) are **explicitly out of scope**
- All members have equal baseline rights
- Any role differentiation (moderators, facilitators) is:
  - temporary
  - revocable
  - granted by peer governance
- No feature, permission, or rule may assume asymmetric power

### Rationale

- Prevents infinite structural permutations
- Ensures one governance model, one voting system, one AI execution pipeline
- Aligns with mutual credit, local trust, and bounded community scale
- Non-peer groups must fork into a different product or system

### Consequences

- "Company cells" are not supported
- All future configuration options must preserve peer symmetry
- AI must enforce peer constraints as hard invariants

---

## Decision 2 — Cell Genesis Starts with an Idea

**Status:** Locked

### Statement

A Cell **must originate from a stated idea**.
No Cell can exist without an explicit founding idea.

The **first action** taken by the founding user is to **express the idea that brings the cell into existence**.

### Definition

A **Founding Idea** is:

- A natural-language description of a shared intention, need, or purpose
- The social attractor that justifies forming a peer group
- The reference point for inviting others into the cell

Without an idea, the system does nothing.

### Interface Requirement

- The initial interface is a **single input**:
  - Voice-to-text (primary)
  - Text input (fallback)
- Prompted as:

> "What is the idea you want to bring people together around?"

### AI Role (at this stage)

After the idea is submitted, the AI must:

1. Clarify and restate the idea in concise form
2. Infer the **primary trust basis** (geographic / organisational / project / social)
3. Suggest the **next concrete step** to advance the idea
4. Prepare a short **invitation summary** the founder can share

The AI does **not** create structure yet. It only helps make the idea legible and shareable.

### Rationale

- Ideas, not tools, form communities
- Prevents empty or aimless cells
- Ensures every invitation has a meaningful social context
- Makes onboarding relational, not procedural

### Consequences

- No cell exists until a second person joins the idea
- The idea remains editable until the second member joins
- All early growth is idea-driven, not feature-driven

---

## Decision 3 — Cell Formation Requires Endorsement, Not Just Joining

**Status:** Locked

### Statement

After an idea is captured and shared, the **second person must endorse it** — not merely join.

Endorsement is the first costly signal that transforms a private thought into a social object.

### Definition

**Endorsement** means a second person takes a small public action:

- "I back this enough to attach my name to it"
- "I agree to the core principles at a high level"
- "I'm willing to help shape it"

Not implementation yet. Not governance yet. Just **legitimacy**.

### Why Endorsement (not joining)

- An idea in one mind has no external constraint
- Sharing creates exposure but not commitment
- Endorsement is the first *costly signal* (reputation risk) that creates credibility and attracts further coalition members

### Minimum Artifact

At endorsement, the system produces:

- **A one-screen "Core Principles" draft (3–5 bullets)** generated from the founding idea
- The second person explicitly endorses (or edits then endorses)

### Consequences

- Two endorsers = seed coalition
- Next step becomes clarification + boundary setting (who it's for, who it isn't for)
- No Cell exists with only one person — a Cell requires at least two endorsers

---

## Decision 4 — Co-definition and Boundary Setting

**Status:** Locked

### Statement

Once a second person endorses, the two endorsers must **jointly sharpen and bound the idea**. This transforms a vague intention into a *selective attractor*.

### What Happens

The two endorsers jointly clarify:

- What the idea **is**
- What it **is not**

This introduces **exclusion**, which is essential for coherence.

Psychologically and evolutionarily, this is where a coalition defines its *identity boundary*.

### Why Now

- Without boundaries, growth produces noise, not alignment
- Early exclusion prevents later conflict
- This is the last low-cost moment to correct course before commitments form

### Minimum Artifacts

**Scope Statement:**
- "This is for…"
- "This is not for…"

**Cell Boundary (explicit):**
- Geographic / Organisational / Project / Social (inferred earlier, now made explicit)

### Consequence

At this point, the idea is no longer just endorsed — it is **defined**.

---

## Decision 5 — Commitment Through Minimum Viable Action

**Status:** Locked

### Statement

Once the idea is endorsed and bounded, the founders must take a **small, concrete action** — a costly signal that proves intent and filters out tourists.

### Why Now

- Coalitions stabilize when members **pay a cost** (time/effort/reputation)
- Costly signals reduce free-riding and fake alignment
- Without action, you get "talk-only" groups that never become institutions

### Definition

A **Minimum Viable Action (MVA)** is:

- **Small** (1–2 hours)
- **Concrete** (observable outcome)
- **Repeatable** (can be done again)
- **Aligned** with the scope and principles

### Examples

- Run one local exchange (one help request fulfilled)
- Host one meetup / call
- Create the first "needs/offers" list
- Agree the first mutual credit limits (draft only)

### Minimum Artifacts

**First Action Record:**
- What was done
- By whom
- When
- What was learned

**Next Action:**
- Scheduled (date/time or trigger condition)

### Consequence

Once you've done one real action, recruitment becomes credible and the system can start scaling.

---

## Decision 6 — Coalition Formation: 5–12 Aligned Members

**Status:** Locked

### Statement

After the first real action, deliberately build a **small core group** (5–12 members) through explicit invitation. This is the founding coalition that can carry norms, resolve disputes, and sustain momentum.

### Why This Threshold

Groups become stable when they cross a threshold where:

- Roles can rotate
- Social proof exists
- Coordination doesn't collapse if one person drops

In practice: **5–12 members** (small-group dynamics: enough diversity, still high trust).

### What Happens

Founders invite specific people who:

- Agree to the core principles
- Are willing to participate
- Bring complementary capabilities

Each new member must give an explicit **"yes"** to:

- The idea statement
- The scope boundary
- The expectation of contribution

### Minimum Artifacts

**Member List:**
- Names with join timestamps

**Member Pledge (3–5 principles):**
- Explicit agreement to core values

**Participation Expectation:**
- e.g., "one exchange or contribution per month"

### Consequence

At 5–12 members, you move from "founders coordinating" to **norm-setting and governance primitives**.

---

## Decision 7 — Norm-Setting: Minimal Rules of the Game

**Status:** Locked

### Statement

Once you have a core coalition, lock **shared norms** so cooperation scales without constant negotiation.

### Why Now

- Once membership > ~10, informal coordination breaks
- Norms reduce transaction costs and prevent predictable conflicts
- This is where a group becomes an *institution seed*

### What Gets Defined (Minimal Set)

**1. Membership Rules**
- Invite-only (default)
- Probation length (T_p)
- Removal process (rare, but defined)

**2. Exchange Rules**
- What counts as a trade
- Default pricing (e.g., 1 hour = 1 credit)
- Confirmation requirement (both parties)

**3. Credit Guardrails**
- Debt floor (L)
- Credit ceiling (U)

**4. Dispute Path**
- Private resolution → Mediator → Council vote

### Minimum Artifacts

**Cell Charter v0.1:**
- One-page document of operating rules

**Initial Numeric Parameters:**
- (L, U) — credit limits
- T_p — probation period

**Named Temporary Roles (if any):**
- Facilitator / Mediator (revocable by peer governance)

### Consequence

Once these norms exist, you can safely introduce the **ledger as a shared system** rather than a social promise.

---

## Decision 8 — Launch the Ledger: First Real Exchanges

**Status:** Locked

### Statement

Operationalize the institution by running **first transactions on a shared record**. This is where the system stops being "a group" and becomes "a functioning economy."

### Why Now

- Norms without execution are cheap talk
- A ledger creates accountability, memory, and fairness at low social cost
- Early ledger use reveals rule flaws quickly while the group is still small

### What Happens

**Start small:**
- 10–30 trades to "test the rails"

**Enforce charter rules strictly:**
- Double confirmation (both parties)
- Time-based default pricing
- Bounds enforced: L ≤ bᵢ ≤ U

**Track frictions:**
- Disputes, unclear scope, pricing exceptions

### Minimum Artifacts

**Balance Vector:**
- bᵢ initialized at 0 for all members

**Transaction Log:**
- Symmetric updates: bᵢ ← bᵢ + x, bⱼ ← bⱼ - x

**After-Action Review:**
- What rules broke, what needs tightening

### Consequence

Once you've got real ledger activity, you can start formalizing **governance** (roles, voting, councils) because there's now something real to govern.

---

## Decision 9 — Dispute + Exception Handling: The Edge-Case Pipeline

**Status:** Locked

### Statement

After first ledger activity, formalize **how exceptions get resolved** so the system doesn't fracture socially. Early disputes are selection events — mishandled disputes destroy trust faster than any bug.

### Why Now

- A functioning institution needs a predictable path from conflict → resolution
- This is the first real test of legitimacy
- Without this, scaling produces chaos

### 3-Stage Resolution Pipeline

**1. Direct Resolution Window (default: 48 hours)**
- Parties attempt to resolve privately
- Either can propose: correction / partial credit / redo

**2. Mediation**
- A rotating mediator (or two-person panel)
- Mediator proposes a binding recommendation unless escalated

**3. Council Decision**
- Small rotating council (3–5 members)
- Vote decides final adjustment to ledger entry

### Exception Types (explicitly supported)

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Partial completion | Work done but incomplete |
| Quality mismatch | Delivered ≠ expected |
| No-show / cancellation | One party didn't show |
| Pricing exception | Mutual agreement to deviate from default |

### Minimum Artifacts

**Dispute Protocol v0.1:**
- One-page document defining the pipeline

**Ledger Correction Mechanism:**
- Who can adjust, with what record

**Rotating Mediator List:**
- Named members eligible to mediate

### Consequence

Once disputes are handled reliably, the group can **scale and replicate without constant founder intervention**.

---

## Decision 10 — Replication and Recruitment: Grow by Invitation

**Status:** Locked

### Statement

Once disputes are handled predictably, the institution is stable enough to grow. Growth happens through **deliberate invitation, not broadcast**.

### Why Now

- Stability precedes scale
- Recruitment before dispute resolution leads to norm dilution and conflict
- Invitation-based growth preserves trust and alignment

### What Happens

**Existing members invite new members selectively.**

Each invitee must:
- Read the idea + charter
- Agree to principles
- Enter probation period

**Growth is capped** to preserve cohesion (e.g., no more than +3 members per month).

### Minimum Artifacts

**Invite Log:**
- Who invited whom, when

**Probation Rules Enforced:**
- Restricted credit bounds
- Limited governance rights

**Membership Growth Rate Cap:**
- Explicit limit on new members per period

### Consequence

The institution can grow to **~30–50 members** without collapsing. The next step is **formal governance** so founders don't become permanent authorities.

---

## Decision 11 — Governance Formalization: Rotate Authority Away from Founders

**Status:** Locked

### Statement

Once membership grows beyond ~30–50, founder-led coordination stops scaling. **Institutionalize authority** so no individual becomes structurally central.

### Why Now

- Founder dominance creates hidden hierarchy
- Rotating authority prevents capture and burnout
- Predictable governance increases perceived fairness → increases participation

### What Happens

**Define a minimal governance structure:**
- Small rotating council (3–5 people)
- Fixed term length (e.g., 3 months)
- Recall mechanism

**Define what governance CAN change:**
- Parameters (L, U, T_p)
- Mediators
- Minor rules

**Define what governance CANNOT change:**
- Peer symmetry (Decision 1)
- Ledger invariants
- Invite-only rule

**Introduce formal voting for:**
- Rule changes
- Credit parameter changes
- Member removal (rare, high threshold)

### Minimum Artifacts

**Governance Charter v1.0:**
- Full operating document

**Council Selection + Rotation Schedule:**
- How members are chosen, term lengths

**Non-Negotiable Invariants List:**
- Explicit enumeration of what cannot be changed by governance

### Consequence

The system is no longer founder-dependent. It is now a **self-governing peer institution**.

---

## Decision 12 — Institutional Memory: Make the System Legible

**Status:** Locked

### Statement

Now that governance exists, **externalize memory** so the institution doesn't rely on oral history or long-term members to function.

### Why Now

- Institutions fail when knowledge is implicit
- Legibility reduces onboarding cost and conflict
- Memory allows continuity across member turnover

### What Happens

**The system consolidates:**
- The founding idea
- Core principles
- Scope boundaries
- Charter + governance rules
- Dispute outcomes (summarized, anonymized)

This becomes a **living institutional record**, not a static wiki.

### Minimum Artifacts

**Cell Handbook (auto-generated):**
- "What this cell is"
- "How things work"
- "How decisions are made"

**Change Log:**
- What rules changed, when, and why

**New-Member Onboarding Path:**
- References the institutional record

### Consequence

The institution is **no longer fragile**. It can survive member churn, leadership rotation, and time.

---

## Decision 13 — Scaling with Integrity: Split, Federate, or Replicate

**Status:** Locked

### Statement

Once the cell is stable and active, growth pressure appears. **Choose a scaling path that preserves trust**, instead of letting size silently degrade the system.

### Why Now

- Trust and accountability decay past ~100–150 people
- Unmanaged growth creates hidden hierarchy and disengagement
- Healthy institutions *choose* how they scale

### Scaling Paths

**1. Split**
- Form two peer cells with shared origin
- Ledger freezes at split date; new ledgers start per cell
- Members choose which cell to belong to

**2. Federate**
- Remain independent cells
- Define limited inter-cell exchange rules
- Share ideas, not governance

**3. Replicate**
- Help seed a new cell elsewhere
- Reuse the template, not the membership

### Minimum Artifacts

**Scaling Decision Record:**
- Which path was chosen, why

**If Splitting:**
- Cutover plan (timeline, ledger freeze, membership allocation)

**If Federating:**
- Scope-limited interop agreement

### Consequence

The institution has proven it can **grow without losing coherence**.

---

## Decision 14 — Selection and Evolution: Adapt or Die (Deliberately)

**Status:** Locked

### Statement

This is the final step, and it never ends. The institution now operates under **continuous selection pressure** and must periodically choose whether to adapt.

### Selection Pressures

- Member satisfaction
- Participation rates
- Exchange velocity
- Conflict frequency
- Relevance of the founding idea

### What Happens

**At fixed intervals (e.g., every 6 or 12 months), the cell runs a formal reflection cycle:**

- Is the founding idea still relevant?
- Are the rules helping or hindering?
- Is participation rising or falling?

**Proposed changes follow governance rules.**

**If misaligned, the cell may:**
- Revise its scope
- Narrow its mission
- Intentionally wind down

### Minimum Artifacts

**Periodic Review Record:**
- Assessment of health metrics and alignment

**Accepted Changes List:**
- Or a decision to hold steady

**Sunset Decision (optional):**
- If the idea no longer serves the group

### Consequence

The idea has fully completed the loop:

**Private insight → Living institution → Adaptive system**
