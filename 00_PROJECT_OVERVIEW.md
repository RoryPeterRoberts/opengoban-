# TechnoCommune: Building the Alternative

## The Thesis

The documents in the Cabal folder reveal a three-part control architecture:
1. **The Asset** (Vol 2): Nature financialized as $10T+ collateral
2. **The Mechanism** (Vol 1): Unified Ledger where assets are "locked" as tokens
3. **The Lock** (Vol 3): Digital ID required to access the ledger

**The Counter-Architecture:** Build parallel infrastructure that is:
- Decentralized (no single point of failure)
- Permissionless (no ID gate)
- Tangible (based on real goods, not derivatives)
- Resilient (functions offline)

## Research Folders

### 01_LEDGER
Mutual Credit systems that bypass fiat currency entirely.
- MCCS (Mutual Credit Communication System)
- Holochain (agent-centric, offline-first)
- Cyclos (proven local currency infrastructure)

### 02_LEGAL_SHIELD
Legal structures that define trade as "private mutual aid" not regulated commerce.
- Unincorporated Associations (no legal personality = invisible to VASP regs)
- Community Benefit Societies (statutory asset lock against seizure)
- Closed Loop System precedents

### 03_PHYSICAL_NETWORK
Own the infrastructure layer.
- LoRaWAN mesh networking
- Raspberry Pi community servers
- Offline-first database sync (CouchDB/PouchDB)

### 04_SOCIAL_VERIFICATION
Identity through proximity, not surveillance.
- Web of Trust models
- Multi-signature verification for "Proof of Care"
- Reputation systems

### 05_CASE_STUDIES
Existing successful implementations.
- Bristol Pound
- Sardex (Sardinia)
- WIR Bank (Switzerland)
- Timebanking networks

### 06_IMPLEMENTATION
Practical deployment guides.
- MVP specifications
- Pilot program design
- Community onboarding

## The Defense Strategy

| Attack Vector | Defense |
|---------------|---------|
| VASP Regulation | Closed loop (no fiat exchange) |
| "Shadow Economy" label | Transparent internal ledger, cooperative structure |
| Internet kill switch | Mesh network + offline-first sync |
| ID requirement | Web of Trust + physical presence verification |
| Asset seizure | Statutory Asset Lock in CBS constitution |

## First Principles

1. **No fiat ramps** - Credits cannot be bought with Euro. Must be earned.
2. **Circular economy** - Value stays in the community loop.
3. **Physical backing** - 1 token = 1 hour labor OR equivalent goods value.
4. **Witness verification** - Claims require neighbor attestation.
5. **Data sovereignty** - Transaction data never leaves community servers.
