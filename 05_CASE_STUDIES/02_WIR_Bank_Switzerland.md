# WIR Bank: 90 Years of Complementary Currency

## Overview

The WIR Bank (Wirtschaftsring-Genossenschaft) is a complementary currency system in Switzerland that has operated continuously since 1934. It is likely the longest-running and largest-scale mutual credit system in the modern world.

**Founded:** 1934
**Location:** Switzerland
**Members:** 60,000+ users (45,000 SMEs + 15,000 individuals)
**Currency:** WIR Franc (CHW)
**Structure:** Cooperative

## Historical Context

### The Great Depression
> "A small band of independent small to medium size businessmen, mostly from the northern German speaking region of Switzerland, joined together to form this 'internal credit' organization."

In 1934, businesses faced:
- Severe credit shortage
- Depression-era economic collapse
- Large corporations dominating markets

### Ideological Roots
WIR was influenced by the **Ausgleichskassen (AK) movement** from 1931 Germany:
- Anti-usury principles
- Monetary reform advocacy
- "Scriptural money" concepts
- Pre-Keynesian credit-based stimulus ideas

**WIR is the only survivor of this movement.**

## How WIR Works

### The Currency
- **WIR Franc (CHW)** = 1 Swiss Franc (CHF) in value
- Electronic currency only (no paper money)
- Recorded in trade accounts
- **Cannot be redeemed for Swiss Francs**

### The Key Rule
> "According to the WIR Bank's statutes, WIR-Credit cannot be redeemed for Swiss Francs. This design criterion guarantees that money remains within the cooperative circle."

**This is the closed-loop principle in action for 90 years.**

### Credit Creation
- WIR Bank issues credit lines to members
- Credit secured by member assets (personal guarantees)
- New WIR Francs enter circulation through loans
- Members trade in WIR, creating internal velocity

## Debate: Is It Mutual Credit?

### The Critique
> "The literature on WIR Bank in German accurately describes it as 'a loan granting central bank within a cashless closed system'."

WIR is NOT pure peer-to-peer mutual credit because:
- New credits come from WIR Bank loans
- Traders cannot credit each other directly
- Centralized issuance, not distributed

### The Defense
> "The best example we have of a successful large-scale mutual credit clearing system that has stood the test of time."

It functions as mutual credit because:
- Credits circulate among members
- Net system balance managed collectively
- No external money required to trade

**Reality:** WIR is a hybrid - centralized issuance, mutual clearing.

---

## Economic Impact

### Countercyclical Stability
Research by James Stodder demonstrated:
> "The WIR creates a countercyclical system, favouring stability."

When the national economy contracts:
- Businesses turn to WIR for liquidity
- WIR transaction volume increases
- Local trade continues despite credit crunch
- Dampens severity of recession

### Self-Help Success
> "As a self-help measure, it appears to have been successful in large measure in protecting the small, independent businessman against the constantly increasing pressure from large, financially strong competitors."

## Lessons for TechnoCommune

### What Works (90 Years of Proof)
| WIR Principle | Application |
|---------------|-------------|
| Closed loop | No Euro exchange |
| Asset backing | Real goods/services as collateral |
| Cooperative structure | Democratic governance |
| SME focus | Producers and service providers |
| Countercyclical design | Resilience in crisis |

### What to Do Differently
| WIR Limitation | TechnoCommune Alternative |
|----------------|---------------------------|
| Centralized credit issuance | Peer-to-peer mutual credit |
| Bank-like structure | Association/cooperative hybrid |
| Professional management overhead | Automated systems |
| Shrinking mutual credit portion | Keep mutual credit core |

---

## Current Status Warning

> "The mutual credit clearing is still part of the service provided by WIR Bank, but it is a shrinking proportion of their overall operations. WIR is now a conventional bank taking deposits and making loans in Swiss francs."

**Lesson:** Over time, successful alternative systems face pressure to become conventional. Design must resist this drift.

---

## Key Success Factors

### 1. Interest-Free Credit at Scale
> "WIR has proven that interest-free credit can be offered on a large scale."

Interest is not required for a credit system to function.

### 2. Professional Management
> "Its superior management was a key factor to its success."

Not idealists, but practical businesspeople who understood both the problem and the solution.

### 3. Legal Clarity
Operating since 1934 with Swiss regulatory acceptance demonstrates that alternative currencies can coexist with national systems.

### 4. Member Benefits
- Liquidity in tight markets
- Marketing to WIR network members
- Countercyclical stability
- Community solidarity
