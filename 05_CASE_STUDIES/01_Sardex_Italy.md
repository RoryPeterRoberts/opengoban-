## Origin Story

### The Crisis
> "The local economy was devastated as credit conditions severely deteriorated, notably credit to households and SMEs."

In 2006, founders began researching international monetary systems and their impact on local economies. By 2009, with GDP dropping and unemployment soaring, "the core team of four young Sardinians decided that 'something had to be done' as no existing institution was ready to tackle the economic depression."

### The Solution
Create a parallel economy where businesses trade directly, bypassing the banking system that had failed them.

## How Sardex Works

### Core Mechanism
- **B2B mutual credit** - Businesses trade goods/services for Sardex credits
- **No fiat purchase** - You cannot buy Sardex with Euros
- **Must earn to spend** - Credits come from providing value
- **No interest** - Credits don't accrue interest (positive or negative)
- **Credit limits** - Members can go negative up to a limit

### Membership Model
| Business Type | Annual Fee |
|--------------|------------|
| Social/Non-profit | 200 EUR |
| Small business | Variable |
| Large company | 2,000 EUR |

**Revenue model:** Membership fees, not transaction fees.

## Success Metrics

- **51+ million EUR** in reciprocal transaction volume
- **84+ million EUR** total transactions since founding

### Economic Impact
Successfully boosted the local economy during recession by:

- Keeping economic activity within the region
- Building trust between local businesses
- Creating network effects that reinforced local trade

## Expansion Beyond B2B

- Companies offer Sardex credits for overtime, bonuses
- Employees spend credits at participating local businesses
- Keeps employee spending local

### Business-to-Consumer (B2C)
- Sardex Bisoo credit card
- Consumers earn points when buying with Euros

## Key Success Factors

### 1. Trust as Foundation
> "Trust was and continues to be fundamentally important for the creation and operation of the mutual credit system."

The system works because:
- Founders personally vetted early members
- Geographic proximity enables reputation
- Sardinian cultural identity creates solidarity

### 2. Self-Funded Social Impact
Academic research describes Sardex as "self-funded social impact investment":
- No external capital required
- Private funding generated endogenously
- Value stays in the community

### 3. Economic + Social Value
> "Sardex encompasses and mediates both economic and social value(s)."
> "Promotes stable and constructive integration of market activity with democratic institutions and socio-cultural values."

It's not just economics - it rebuilds social fabric.

### 4. Professional Management
> "It was not a couple of dreamers that built it, but down-to-earth businessmen understanding the issues and the solution."
